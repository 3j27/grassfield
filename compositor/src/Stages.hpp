// Stages (Grassfield's stage manager, M5, behind the feature flag config stagesEnabled): Hyprland 0.56.2 glue for
// core/Stages.* (model, validation, geometry). The windows of inactive stages stay mapped on their workspace, at their
// real places, live: a Render::IWindowTransformer draws each one into the shell's strip tile, and a plugin-owned input
// block reason (CWindow::setInputBlocked) keeps pointer and keyboard away from their real places. Nothing is ever moved,
// resized or configured (the one exception: a window a titlebar drag dropped on the strip gets back its place from before
// that drag, dropOnStrip), so turning Stages off or unloading the plugin only detaches transformers and lifts the blocks.
// Compositor thread only, nothing blocks. Spec: docs/specs/stages.md; decision: docs/decisions/ADR-0013-stages.md.
