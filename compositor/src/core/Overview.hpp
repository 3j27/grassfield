// Overview v2 ("Mission Control" with live windows, master-prompt §5.6 feature 4): request parsing, validation and
// animation math. Plain C++ with no Hyprland includes, so it is unit-testable (compositor/tests/OverviewTest.cpp).
// The Hyprland glue (Overview.cpp) draws each real window, live, at the box computed here (spec: docs/specs/overview.md
// "v2"; mechanism: docs/specs/overview.md "v2 spike").
//
// Coordinates are layout coordinates (Hyprland's global logical space, what `hyprctl clients` reports as at/size).
