// A window's titlebar never goes under the menu bar (macOS): a drag that would leave the top of a floating window under
// it, or above the output, keeps it just below the menu bar, so the window can always be grabbed again. The titlebar is
// the plugin's (a band above the surface) or the app's own (no band: client chrome, ADR-0015, e.g. Chromium's tab
// strip, which is how the owner lost a window under the menu bar). Only the top is held: a window may still hang off
// the sides or the bottom of an output. Pure logic, no Hyprland includes: unit-tested in tests/TopClampTest.cpp.
