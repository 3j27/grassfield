// The dark appearance's light inner rim (ADR-0024 note 2026-11-03; core/WindowRim.hpp holds the geometry and the rules):
// a window decoration on Hyprland's OVER layer, so drawn right after the window's surface and under its popups, that adds
// one ring of Hyprland's border shader (CBorderPassElement) inside the window's frame: its surface, and the plugin's
// titlebar above it while that is shown. One per window, next to its titlebar (main.cpp decorate()); nothing reserved,
// no input. Without the plugin there is no rim (gate C2); the unload removes every rim and damages where it was.
