// Deferred focus, Hyprland 0.56.2 glue shared by Stages (docs/specs/stages.md ST10, ST23, ST24) and the overview focus
// (docs/specs/overview.md "Close focus"), for the decisions in core/DeferredFocus.*: Hyprland's own refusal conditions
// (read only: the plugin never changes Hyprland's lists, R13 counter-review #3 of e9ebc7f), the keyboard holder, where a
// press goes while an Exclusive layer is mapped, Hyprland's focus reasons, and one coalesced attempt from the event loop.
// Compositor thread only, nothing blocks.
