// The logic of grassfield-stack-helper (ADR-0025), Qt Core only so that it can be unit tested: the order of a folder stack, the
// bounded window of its first entries, the scan of a folder (readdir and statx, an entry that vanishes is skipped), and the
// line the helper writes. The Name order is Files' by construction: FileLogic::compareEntries (apps/files/src/filelogic.cpp,
// compiled in as it is) with the QCollator that FolderModel sets up.
