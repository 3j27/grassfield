// with Selection): applied all together or not at all, and reverted or applied again as one undo or redo step (the Finder
// records one step per command; KIO's FileUndoManager records one per job, so Files keeps these commands itself and orders
// them against KIO's by serial number, FilesApp::undo). Qt Core and system calls only; unit tested.
