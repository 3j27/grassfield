// Per-folder view settings (docs/specs/files.md FP-14, decision F-3): the view and the arrangement the user chose for a
// folder, kept in a per-user state file keyed by the folder's URL (`files-views.json` in the Grassfield state directory,
// 0600, written atomically). Files never writes into the folder itself (macOS keeps these in `.DS_Store`): read-only,
// remote, Trash and search locations work alike and other applications never see a stray file. At most kMaxEntries
// folders and kMaxFileSize bytes; the least recently set folders are dropped first. Several Files processes share the
// file: reads follow its changes, and each write takes a lock, reads the file again and merges into it.
//
// The file is read like the shell's settings store (shell/store/SettingsStore.qml): never opened unless the path leads to
// a regular file (a FIFO would block the UI thread in open(), a device such as /dev/zero would never end), at most
// kMaxFileSize + 1 bytes read, and used only when the read returned exactly the size the file had. A change on disk is
// noticed by the signature of what the path leads to: device, inode, size, mode and modification time (to the nanosecond).
//
// Nothing here waits for another process: a write that finds the lock taken stays pending (entry() already reads it) and
// flush() writes it later (FilesApp retries on a timer); only the final flush at exit waits, briefly.
