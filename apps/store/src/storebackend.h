// The Store window's backend (ADR-0037 steps 2 and 3; spec SR1-SR23, SR24 read-only, SR26-SR29): what the QML reads, and the
// work behind it off the GUI thread. Each load builds one immutable Snapshot in a worker (pacman's lists, Arch's AppStream,
// the cached catalog checked again, the web apps' launchers, the merged model) and the window swaps it in whole; a fetch
// (the catalog when its copy is older than 6 hours or on Ctrl+R, its icons, Arch's AppStream package when none is
// installed) runs only online, and never on a metered connection without Ctrl+R. Get and Uninstall… plan first (the plan
// check, plancheck.h, on a worker), then queue an operation (operations.h) once the sheet's default button is pressed;
// Open starts the app (ADR-0011). A link opens in the browser, https only, never in a dev session.
