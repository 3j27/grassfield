// macOS 27 Battery > Options…: a sheet over the Settings window. Grassfield has the one option it can back: Prevent automatic
// sleeping when the display is off (energy.preventSleep; the shell's idle module, shell/security/idle). Unlike macOS's "on
// power adapter" switch it applies on battery too (integrator decision 2026-11-04: Grassfield never put a computer to sleep by
// itself before, and on by default it keeps it that way); the footnote says so. Wake for network access, Slightly dim the
// display on battery and Optimize video streaming have no counterpart here. Second option (ADR-0048): Slow down apps you can't
// see while on battery (energy.slowHiddenApps, on by default; the shell's AppEnergy and grassfield-energy). The switches write
// at once; Done closes the sheet.
