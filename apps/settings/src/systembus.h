// The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sections over D-Bus (GF-049): NetworkManager (org.freedesktop.NetworkManager) and BlueZ (org.bluez), both
// on the system bus, instead of scraping `nmcli` and `bluetoothctl`. The logic here talks to a BusCaller, so the unit tests
// (tests/unit/settings/tst_systembus.cpp) run it against a canned one with no bus at all, and the integration tests
// (tests/integration/settings_dbus.sh) run it on a PRIVATE bus against fake services. The audio section stays on `wpctl`:
// PipeWire and WirePlumber have no D-Bus interface (see docs/specs/settings.md).
//
// Every call goes through one door, `guardedCall`: in a dev session (GRASSFIELD_DEV=1, a nested Hyprland on the owner's
// machine) only the read-only methods of `isReadOnlyCall` are sent, whatever asks; nothing can change the owner's network or
// Bluetooth from there. Qt Core, Qt DBus types only.
