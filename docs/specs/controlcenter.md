# Quick Settings spec · shell-engineer · M2

UI naming (renamed 2026-10-18, owner decision): internally `controlcenter` / `ControlCenter.qml`; the user sees "Quick Settings" (fr « Réglages rapides »). The Focus tile is "Do Not Disturb" (fr « Ne pas déranger »), subtitle On/Off. A long module title wraps to a second line inside its tile (two lines at most, then an ellipsis; no font shrink), as macOS does; the accessible name stays "title, state".

## macOS reference behavior (described in words; measured in docs/testing/f1-reference-gaps.md, gap 6)
- Opens from the Quick Settings icon (two toggles) at the right of the menu bar. There is no shared panel: every module
  is its own glass shape on a 4-column grid (cells 63 pt, gaps 13, 291 pt wide), 14 pt from the right edge of the screen and
  about 13 pt below the bar.
- Modules: Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / AirDrop 2x1 capsules (139 x 63; we show Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode), Do Not Disturb 2x1,
  Now Playing 2x2 (138 x 139, radius ~30), Display and Sound slider modules (291 x 63, radius 20, bold title, 4 pt track).
- Clicking a capsule's text opens that module as a detail panel (a list of networks or devices) in place of the grid; a back
  button returns. The icon disk (36 pt, filled with the accent when on) toggles.

## M1 subset (implemented, shell-engineer; the 320 px single panel was replaced by the modules below)
Opened by the Quick Settings menu bar icon (`qs.overlay/ControlCenter.qml`): Appearance (Light/Dark), Transparency slider (`material.transparency` 0–1, live), Reduce Transparency toggle, Reduce Motion toggle, output volume slider. Everything persists to grassfield.json through `Settings` (see ui.md). Verified: screenshots at transparency 0, 0.25, 0.6 and in the light appearance; `grassfield.json` written in the dev config dir. 

## Fidelity pass 2: floating modules (shell-engineer)
`shell/overlay/ControlCenter.qml` + `shell/overlay/controlcenter/*` (pure logic in `Model.js`, tests `tests/unit/tst_ccmodel.qml`; `Module.qml` is the glass surface).
- Grid (tokens `quicksettings.*`, `panel.controlCenterWidth` 291): cell 63, gap 13, 4 columns. Left: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode (2x1 capsules, 36-pt icon disk, title wraps to two lines, status line). Right: Do Not Disturb (2x1) and, while a player runs, Now Playing (2x2); with no player Appearance (2x1) takes that slot and Airplane Mode spans the full width. Below: Display (hidden without a backlight), Keyboard Brightness (only with a `*kbd_backlight` LED) and Sound (mute, slider, device chevron) as 4x1 slider modules (radius 20, bold title, 4 pt track); Appearance as a 4x1 capsule when a player runs.
- Each module is its own `Module` (Material, no shadow). `ControlCenter.surfaces` lists the visible ones; `Overlay.qml` builds one blur region per surface (`Variants` of `Region`), so every module blurs on its own (never a fake blur); the hosting window stays one transparent layer-shell surface. Position: right edge at `quicksettings.edgeMargin` (14), top at the bar plus `quicksettings.topGap` (13), set in `Overlay.qml` (the menu bar item only opens the popup).
- Detail module: opening Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Sound (output and input lists) or Appearance (Appearance + Material) replaces the grid with ONE 4-column module: back button, title, power toggle (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), then the list. Esc and the Left key go back first, then Esc closes; focus returns to the capsule that opened it. The chevron of a capsule shows on hover, focus or while open (a 139-pt capsule has no room for it permanently).
- Keyboard (macOS model): Tab follows the grid rows (modules are declared in row order). Up/Down move focus to the module above or below and Left/Right to the control beside (spatial navigation, `Model.navTarget`), so walking the grid with Down never changes a value. A focused slider changes with Left/Right (Home/End: ends) only; its Up/Down move focus (`Slider.verticalKeys: false`; other sliders keep Up/Down as values). Space toggles a capsule; Return too, except on a capsule with a detail module (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Appearance), where Return opens it, and so does Right on the last capsule of a row. Left (or Esc) goes back in a detail module, then Esc closes.
- Not built (measured in the reference, no backend or out of scope): AirDrop, Screen Mirroring, Stage Manager and Screenshot 1x1 modules, edit mode (minus badges, controls gallery, size menu).
- Wi-Fi: Quickshell Networking; scan list (deduplicated, connected first, then strength), lock icon for secured, connect to known/open networks, new WPA/WPA2/WPA3-personal network: inline password field (`connectWithPsk`), 802.1X: `nm-connection-editor`. Scanning is enabled only while the list is open. SSIDs are PlainText and elided.
- Bluetooth: paired devices, connect/disconnect, battery if exposed. Devices are not discovered or paired from here (no pairing flow).
- Airplane Mode (CC3, conflict C-QS-1 resolved: the rfkill requirement is the stricter and is implemented): an rfkill soft block of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular radios (`rfkill block|unblock wlan bluetooth wwan`, `shell/services/Rfkill.qml`, pure parsing in `Rfkill.js`). No root: `/dev/rfkill` is opened through the session's uaccess ACL (logind). State is read from `rfkill --json list` and refreshed by `rfkill event` (event driven). NetworkManager and BlueZ follow the block. When rfkill is not usable (no `/dev/rfkill`, not readable and writable by the user, or no `rfkill` tool) the capsule falls back to the Wi-Fi radio (NetworkManager) and the Bluetooth adapter power (BlueZ) and says why in the note capsule ("Airplane Mode: <reason>; using the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth switches") and in the log. The dev guard applies to both paths.
- Battery module (§5.2 duty, macOS Battery menu; hidden without a laptop battery): a 4x2 module "Battery" with the percentage, the power source (Power Adapter or Battery), time remaining or until full, and a Low Power Mode switch (the power-saver profile of power-profiles-daemon through `PowerProfiles`; off returns to Balanced). `shell/services/Battery.qml`, logic in `BatteryLogic.js`, test `tests/unit/tst_battery.qml`. The dev guard refuses the profile change.
- Night Shift: a switch in the Display module (macOS keeps it in Display settings), driving `packaging/bin/grassfield-nightshift on|off|status` (interface unchanged: `status` prints `on` or `off`; hyprsunset behind it). Hidden when the helper or hyprsunset is missing. The state is read each time Quick Settings opens and after each change (no event source). The dev guard refuses the change (hyprsunset is the owner's). `shell/services/NightShift.qml`.
- Slider IPC (acceptance CC5/6): `qs ipc call controlcenter volume <0..1>` and `brightness <0..1>` make the same calls as the sliders (the dev guard answers `refused: dev guard`); `volumeLevel` and `brightnessLevel` read what the sliders show. Volume scale: PipeWire stores a linear volume (Quickshell `PwNodeAudio.volume`); `wpctl`, pavucontrol and the volume keys use the cubic one (`wpctl get-volume` 0.50 is linear 0.125). The shell shows and sets the cubic value everywhere (sliders, menu bar label, OSD, `volumeLevel`; `Audio.qml`, `VolumeScale.js`, `tests/unit/tst_volumescale.qml`), so the slider is perceptual and equals `wpctl`; `volumeLevel` reads the real sink even under visual fixtures (`Audio.deviceVolume`), not the fixed 0.50. Test hooks: refused (`refused`) outside a dev session (docs/specs/security.md "IPC surface", SEC-04). Test: `tests/shell/cc_sliders_ipc.sh` (nested). The write half of the acceptance is the owner's L2 check with the sliders themselves (drag, then `wpctl get-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@` / `brightnessctl -m get`).
- Sound: output and input device lists (PipeWire), default checked.
- Dev guard (`GRASSFIELD_DEV=1`): Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/airplane toggles, connects, device switches and mute are not executed (logged as `dev guard: ... suppressed`, a "dev: not applied" capsule appears under the modules); nothing ever changes the owner's audio (volume, mute, default output or input, volume keys), brightness, keyboard backlight or the Now Playing transport: every audio write goes through `Audio.backendWrite()`, which refuses before touching the backend (no exception path; `tests/shell/audio_dev_guard.sh`). A slider whose change is refused snaps back to the real value.
- Known gaps: Bluetooth device lists are not exercised in the dev session guard keyboard backlight and Bluetooth device rows unverified on this hardware (no kbd LED, no paired devices).

## Auto appearance (CC8, owner decision 2026-10-23: follow macOS)
Appearance offers Light, Dark and Auto in Quick Settings (Appearance detail) and in Settings > Appearance; the same `appearance` key (`dark|light|auto`) in both. macOS Auto is light by day and dark at night, switching at sunset and sunrise. Grassfield has no location service, so it uses the macOS fallback: a fixed local schedule, dark from 19:00 to 07:00 (tokens `autoAppearance.darkFromHour` 19 and `darkToHour` 7, local clock). The rule is one pure function (`ui/Grassfield/Ui/AutoAppearance.js`; C++ copy `apps/autoappearance.h` for Files and Preview, kept equal to the tokens by `tests/shell/auto_appearance_tokens.sh`). The shell, Settings, Files and Preview re-evaluate it every `autoAppearance.recheckInterval` (60 s) only while the setting is "auto", so every surface switches within a minute of the boundary. The Quick Settings capsule subtitle shows Light, Dark or Auto; its glyph shows the appearance in effect.

## Purpose and non-goals
Quick settings backed by real services only (§5.8): NetworkManager (Quickshell Networking), BlueZ (Quickshell
Bluetooth), PipeWire (Quickshell Pipewire), UPower, MPRIS, brightness via `brightnessctl` or logind
`SetBrightness` (no root). Non-goals: AirDrop, Screen Mirroring (no backend), privileged commands from QML.

## Functional requirements
1. CC1 Wi-Fi tile: on/off, current SSID; expand → scan list, connect to known/open networks; secured new
   network → password field (NetworkManager agent via Quickshell if available, else open `nm-connection-editor`).
2. CC2 Bluetooth tile: power on/off, expand → paired devices connect/disconnect.
3. CC3 Airplane mode: rfkill soft block (no root); NetworkManager/BlueZ switches only as the stated fallback.
4. CC4 Do Not Disturb tile ↔ notifications DND.
5. CC5 Display brightness slider (hidden if no backlight device), keyboard brightness if present.
6. CC6 Sound: output volume slider + mute; expand → output device list (Pipewire sinks); input device list.
7. CC7 Now Playing: MPRIS title/artist/art, play/pause/next/prev on the active player.
8. CC8 Material: transparency slider (`material.transparency`, 0–1) and appearance (Light/Dark/Auto).
9. CC9 Keyboard: Tab/arrow navigation across tiles, Space toggles, Esc closes; every control has Accessible.name.
10. CC10 All values update live from the services (no polling except what the service APIs require).

## Acceptance criteria
| ID | Test | Level |
|---|---|---|
| CC5/6 | change slider via IPC → `wpctl get-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@` matches | L1 |
| CC8 | slider at 0 / 0.25 / 0.6 → 3 screenshots, A2 contrast script passes | L1 |
| CC9 | keyboard-only scenario reaches every control | L1 |
| CC1–3 | owner checks with real hardware | L2† |

## Degraded behavior
Missing service → tile hidden with a note in the spec, never a fake toggle.

## Known limitations
- Wi-Fi Enterprise (802.1X) setup delegates to nm-connection-editor.
- No AirDrop / Screen Mirroring equivalents.
