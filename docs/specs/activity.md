# Activity Monitor spec · apps-engineer (app), shell-engineer (projection, IPC, Dock tile) · owner brief 2026-10-28
Decision record: `docs/decisions/ADR-0038-activity-monitor.md` (owner questions AQ1 to AQ7, decisions AD1 to AD31). Parity
row by row: `docs/audits/activity-2026-10-28/parity.md`. Evidence of the kernel facts: `docs/audits/activity-2026-10-28/`
(probes A0 to A8). The app is "Activity Monitor" / « Moniteur d'activité » (owner, AQ1; needs legal review); this spec says
"the app". Internal names: `apps/activity`, `grassfield-activity`, `org.grassfield.Activity`.

Status: step 0 (docs). Requirements are numbered AM1 to AM79, gates AM-P1 to AM-P4; each names the step that builds it
(ADR-0038 "Delivery order", owner AQ7: macOS first). The owner's answers of 2026-10-28 are built in: AQ2 TCP only and
labelled, AQ3 the Energy Impact index, AQ4 other owners' processes shown read-only, AQ5 End Task behind a setting, AQ6
Ctrl+Shift+Esc. Revised after the integrator's opus review of e3882de (ADR-0038 "Review history"); the changed requirements
say "review of e3882de".

## macOS reference behavior (Apple's Activity Monitor User Guide, macOS 27; described in words, no Apple image committed)
- One window: a toolbar with the Stop button, the Info button and an action menu, five tabs (CPU, Memory, Energy, Disk,
  Network), a search field; the process table; the summary of the tab at the bottom of the window.
- CPU: System, User and Idle shares, the CPU load graph, Threads and Processes. Memory: the Memory Pressure graph, Physical
  Memory, Memory Used (App Memory, Wired Memory, Compressed), Cached Files, Swap Used. Energy: Energy Impact ("lower is
  better"), 12 hr Power (laptops), App Nap, Preventing Sleep, Graphics Card; at the bottom the battery's charge, time
  remaining or until full, time on battery or on AC, Battery (Last 12 hours). Disk: reads, writes, data read and written,
  per second, graph IO or Data. Network: packets and data in and out, per second, graph Packets or Data.
- View menu: Columns, Dock Icon (application icon, or a live CPU, CPU history, network or disk graph), Update Frequency
  (every 5 seconds by default), the process filters (All Processes; All Processes, Hierarchically; My Processes; System
  Processes; Other User Processes; Active Processes; Inactive Processes; GPU Processes; Windowed Processes; Selected
  Processes; Applications in last 12 hours; Processes, by GPU), Inspect Process, Quit Process, Send Signal to Process.
- Window menu: CPU Usage, CPU History, GPU History.
- Quit ("quits when it's safe to do so") and Force Quit (ends at once, data may be lost); a hung process is "(Not
  Responding)" in red; a process of another user needs an administrator.
- A process's details: double-click or the Info button.

## Windows 11 reference (what is taken; ADR-0038 g)
Processes grouped by type with expandable groups; Performance (CPU overall or per logical processor, memory, disk, network,
GPU, each with details); App history (per app since a date, with a delete action); Efficiency mode (a process's lower
priority, refused for the system's own); columns from the header; search by name or PID; End task from the taskbar's menu
(a switch, off by default); Ctrl+Shift+Esc. Not taken: ADR-0038 h and the parity matrix.

## Purpose and non-goals
Purpose: let the user see what their computer is doing, find what is slow, hot, hung or heavy, and stop it, with macOS 27's
window and the most useful Windows 11 views, at a cost the user does not notice.

Non-goals: root code or polkit actions; any action on another owner's process (AQ4: read-only); stack sampling and
diagnostics; editing login
items (Settings does it); a background collector; any network access.

## Terms
- **Sample:** one read of the counters at the update frequency. A **rate** is the change between two samples divided by the
  wall time between them (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`).
- **Own process:** real uid equals the app's uid (`/proc/<pid>/status` `Uid:` first field). On the tabs that do not read
  `status`, the `/proc/<pid>` directory's owner (the effective uid; root for a non-dumpable process) stands in for it, and
  `status` is read for the processes whose directory says root and whose `stat` flags do not say kernel thread.
  **Other owner's process:** any other uid. **System account:** a uid below `UID_MIN` of `/etc/login.defs` (1000 when the
  file says nothing). **Kernel thread:** `PF_KTHREAD` (0x00200000) in `stat` field 9; kernel threads are never listed one
  by one (AM20a).
- **Row identity:** (pid, start time) where start time is `stat` field 22. A pid with another start time is another process.
- **App unit:** the systemd unit uwsm made for one launch, from `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` (`0::` line): `app-<desktop>-<name>-<8
  hex>.scope` or `app-<desktop>-<name>@<8 hex>.service` under `app-graphical.slice` (ADR-0038 A7, AM65).
- **Runtime folder:** `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/grassfield/activity-<display>/`, `<display>` the last part of `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
  with every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` replaced by "_" (one folder per display: a nested session never shares
  the real session's, review of e3882de).
- **Projection:** the shell's file `windows.json` in the runtime folder (AM60).
- **Writer:** the pid and start time a runtime file names; the file is stale when no process has both.
- **"—":** the kernel refused the read (another owner's or a non-dumpable process, A1) or the driver gives no such value.

## Functional requirements

### Window and navigation (step 2)
- **AM1** One instance: launching the app while it runs brings its main window to the front (the mechanism Settings and the
  Store use). Closing the main window quits the app (AD17).
- **AM2** The main window opens at its last frame (`activity.json`), else at the token size `activity.windowWidth` ×
  `activity.windowHeight`, never smaller than `activity.windowMinWidth` × `activity.windowMinHeight`. Opaque window, ADR-0024
  radius, unified toolbar (ADR-0015).
- **AM3** Toolbar, left to right: the traffic lights; the title (the app's name) with the current view as subtitle; the
  Stop button (Quit Process, enabled with a selection of own processes); the Info button (Inspect, enabled with one row);
  the action menu (…: Quit Process, Inspect Process, Send Signal to Process…, Efficiency Mode, Copy); the segmented control
  CPU, Memory, Energy, Disk, Network; the search field. Every control has a tooltip, an accessible name and keyboard
  focus.
- **AM4** The tab chosen is remembered. Each tab has its own columns, sort and summary.
- **AM5** The summary area at the bottom of the window has the token height `activity.summaryHeight`; it holds the tab's
  figures (label and value pairs, tokens' type scale) and its graph. Its graphs and the table update at the same sample.
- **AM6** Menus: the app menu (About, Hide, Quit), File (Close Window), Edit (Copy, Select All, Find), View, Window, Help,
  exported to the menu bar (T1, `apps/globalmenu.h`). There is no settings window: the View menu holds the options (macOS).
- **AM7** Light and dark appearance and the accent follow the session; table rows alternate with the token fill
  `activity.rowAlternate`; graphs use tokens only (`activity.graphSystem`, `activity.graphUser`, `activity.graphRead`,
  `activity.graphWrite`, `activity.graphIn`, `activity.graphOut`, `activity.pressureGreen`, `activity.pressureYellow`,
  `activity.pressureRed`), each holding A2's 3:1 against the graph's background in both appearances.
- **AM8** While the window is hidden or minimized no per-process sample is taken (AM-P3). Back on screen, the next sample
  comes at once; rates restart from it (no rate is drawn from a gap).
- **AM9** View > Update Frequency: Very Often (1 sec), Often (2 sec), Normally (5 sec), default Normally; the choice is
  remembered and applies to every window of the app.

### The table (step 2)
- **AM10** A row: the icon (the app's icon for a process of an app, a generic executable glyph otherwise, 16 pt), the name,
  then the tab's columns; PID and User are default columns on every tab (macOS). Another owner's row is drawn like the
  others (macOS); only its actions differ (AM50). A click on a header sorts by it; a second click reverses. Defaults: CPU by % CPU, Memory by
  Memory, Energy by Energy Impact, Disk by Bytes Written, Network by Sent Bytes, each descending.
- **AM11** Selection: one or several rows (Shift, Ctrl). The selection follows its processes (row identity) across samples
  and sorts; a process that ends leaves the selection. The scroll position never jumps on a refresh.
- **AM12** Views (View menu, one checked; the subtitle names it): All Processes (default); All Processes, Hierarchically
  (AM13); My Processes (own); System Processes (system accounts and the Kernel row); Other User Processes (other owners
  that are not system accounts); Active Processes (CPU share above 0 in the last sample); Inactive Processes (the others);
  GPU Processes (with a GPU client); Windowed Processes (owning a window per the projection); Selected Processes (the rows
  selected when chosen, kept until another view); Processes, by Type (AM65); Processes, by GPU (AM49).
- **AM13** Hierarchically: a tree by parent pid (`stat` field 4); a process whose parent is not listed is a root; rows have
  disclosure triangles; expansion is kept across samples.
- **AM14** Search: a live filter (no Return needed), case-insensitive, matching the process name, the app name, the user's
  name, the command (own processes only, AD25) or a PID that starts with the digits typed. Ctrl+F focuses the field, Esc clears it. In a grouped view a
  group stays when one of its processes matches.
- **AM15** Columns: View > Columns lists the current tab's optional columns, checked when shown; the header's context menu
  lists the same. The name column cannot be hidden. Widths are resizable; columns, widths and order are remembered per tab.
- **AM16** Values: sizes in the session's locale with the unit scale Files uses (kB, MB, GB, decimal), times as `h:mm:ss.ss`,
  shares with one decimal, "—" where Terms say so. A column with no value for any row still shows its header.
- **AM17** Names and icons: a process owning a window (projection) takes its app's desktop entry name and icon; another
  process of the same app unit takes the app's icon and its own executable name; any other own process takes the basename
  of `cmdline`'s first word, else `stat`'s short name. Another owner's process always takes `stat`'s short name: its
  `cmdline` is never read (a process can rewrite its `argv[0]` into a title such as "sshd: bob@pts/0", review of e3882de).
  Every name and command line shown has its control characters (Unicode Cc) and format characters (Cf: the bidirectional
  embeddings, overrides and isolates U+202A–U+202E and U+2066–U+2069, the marks U+200E and U+200F, zero-width characters)
  removed before display, so no process can reorder or hide text in a row. A name is plain text (no markup), elided in the
  middle.
- **AM18** Rows of processes that ended go at the next sample; new processes appear at the next sample in sort order.
- **AM19** Edit > Copy (Ctrl+C) copies the selected rows as text: the visible columns' headers, then one line per row,
  values separated by tabs, as shown.

### CPU (step 1 data, step 2 window)
- **AM20** % CPU = Δ(utime + stime) of the whole thread group (`stat` fields 14 and 15) ÷ (Δt × `CLK_TCK`) × 100: a share of
  one logical processor (can pass 100, AD4). The first sample of a process shows "—" in rate columns.
- **AM20a** Kernel row (AD25): one row "Kernel" (fr « Noyau »), user root, PID "—", whose % CPU and CPU Time sum every
  kernel thread's (`stat` only); Threads = their number; other columns "—". It counts in System (AM29) and System Processes
  (AM12). It cannot be selected for an action.
- **AM21** CPU Time = utime + stime since the process started, `h:mm:ss.ss`.
- **AM22** Threads = `stat` field 20.
- **AM23** Wake Ups (optional): Δ of `voluntary_ctxt_switches` summed over `/proc/<pid>/task/*/status` ÷ Δt, for own
  processes. Read while the column or the Energy tab is shown, one fifth of the processes per sample in turn (a new process
  at its first sample), each rate taken over that process's last five samples (A10: every thread at every sample would
  cost 15–18 ms on the reference fixture, review of e3882de). Another owner's process shows "—".
- **AM24** % GPU and GPU Time: AM48.
- **AM25** Open Files (optional): the entries of `/proc/<pid>/fd`, re-counted at most every 10 s per process.
- **AM26** Kind (optional): App, Background or Session (AM65).
- **AM27** Status (optional): Not Responding (projection), Efficiency Mode (AM68), Stopped (`stat` state T), Zombie (Z);
  empty otherwise. The name of a process that does not respond carries " (Not Responding)" (fr « (ne répond pas) », the
  string the Force Quit panel uses) in `colors.danger`, in every tab (macOS).
- **AM28** Command (optional): `cmdline`'s words joined by spaces, elided at the end, sanitized as AM17, for own processes;
  "—" for another owner's process, whose `cmdline` is never read (AM17), and for a process that refuses it.
- **AM29** Summary: System, User, Idle (AD5: User = Σ % CPU of own processes ÷ number of logical processors, System =
  non-idle share of `/proc/stat`'s `cpu` line minus User, never below 0, Idle = `idle + iowait` share); the CPU Load graph
  (System and User stacked, `activity.historySamples` samples); Threads = the total of `/proc/loadavg`'s fourth field;
  Processes = the number of numeric entries of `/proc`.

### Memory (step 1 data, step 2 window)
- **AM30** Memory = `RssAnon + VmSwap` (`status`, AD6). The Memory tab reads `status` of every process at each sample; the
  other tabs do not (A10: 6.7–7.6 µs per process).
- **AM31** Optional: Real Memory (`VmRSS`), Private Memory (`RssAnon`), Shared Memory (`RssFile + RssShmem`), Compressed
  Memory (`VmSwap`; titled Swapped Memory under AM34), Peak Memory (`VmHWM`), Page Ins (`stat` field 12, major faults),
  Threads, PID.
- **AM32** Summary (AD7): Physical Memory, Memory Used, App Memory, Wired Memory, Compressed, Cached Files, Swap Used, from
  `/proc/meminfo`, `/sys/block/zram*/mm_stat` (third field, `mem_used_total`, summed) and `/proc/swaps`. App + Wired +
  Compressed = Memory Used (App is the remainder, never below 0).
- **AM33** Memory Pressure graph: height = `(MemTotal − MemAvailable) ÷ MemTotal`; colour red when `full avg10` of
  `/proc/pressure/memory` ≥ 5 or `MemAvailable` < 5 % of `MemTotal`, else yellow when `some avg10` ≥ 10 or `MemAvailable` <
  15 %, else green (provisional thresholds, pinned by tests, tuned at step 1 with a memory-pressure fixture in a container).
  Without `/proc/pressure` (kernel without PSI) the colour follows the memory left only.
- **AM34** "Compressed Memory" names the column when every active swap device in `/proc/swaps` is zram; otherwise it is
  "Swapped Memory" and Swap Used counts the non-zram devices.
- **AM35** Memory figures are bytes; the summary shows them with AM16's unit scale.

### Energy (step 1 data, step 2 window; AQ3)
- **AM36** Energy Impact (owner, AQ3): a relative index without unit, `EI = %CPU + %GPU + 0.02 × wake-ups/s + 1.0 × disk MB/s`
  (provisional weights; the step calibrates them against the laptop's `power_now` in an owner L2 run, then fixes and pins
  them). Shown with one decimal; never called watts.
- **AM37** Average Energy Impact (optional): the mean of EI since the app opened or since the process started, whichever is
  later; the header's tooltip says so.
- **AM38** Preventing Sleep: "Yes" when the process holds a logind inhibitor whose What includes `sleep` or `idle` in `block`
  mode (`org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.ListInhibitors`, system bus, read when the tab is shown and at each sample), or when
  the projection marks one of its windows `idleInhibit`; "No" otherwise.
- **AM39** Summary: the Energy Impact graph (Σ EI of own processes). On a computer with a battery (UPower's DisplayDevice
  `IsPresent`): Remaining charge (`Percentage`), Time remaining (`TimeToEmpty`, "Calculating…" at 0) or Time until full
  (`TimeToFull`), "Battery Is Charged" when full, Time on battery or Time on AC (from the last state change in UPower's
  history), and Battery (Last 12 hours) (`GetHistory("charge", 43200, 120)`). Without a battery only the graph shows.
- **AM40** Not built: App Nap, Graphics Card, 12 hr Power (ADR-0038 h).

### Disk (step 1 data, step 2 window)
- **AM41** Bytes Read and Bytes Written = `io` `read_bytes` and `write_bytes` since the process started (storage, not page
  cache); optional Read/s and Written/s (rates). "—" when `io` is refused.
- **AM42** Summary from `/proc/diskstats`, counting only whole physical disks (a `/sys/block/<name>/device` link exists: no
  loop, zram, dm or md device, no partition): Reads in (field 4), Writes out (field 8), Data read (field 6 × 512), Data
  written (field 10 × 512), each since boot, and per second; the graph shows IO (reads and writes per second) or Data (bytes
  per second), chosen by a pop-up above it (remembered).

### Network (step 1 data, step 2 window; AQ2)
- **AM43** (owner, AQ2) Sent Bytes, Rcvd Bytes, Sent Packets, Rcvd Packets per process, headed "(TCP)": a `NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG`
  dump of TCP sockets (IPv4 and IPv6) with `tcp_info` (`tcpi_bytes_acked`, `tcpi_bytes_received`, `tcpi_segs_out`,
  `tcpi_segs_in`), each socket matched to the own process whose `fd/` holds `socket:[inode]` (descriptor lists re-read at
  most every 10 s and for new processes). A process's value = Σ over the sockets seen since the app opened (a socket's last
  values are kept after it closes). Descriptor lists are re-read in turn, one tenth of the own processes per sample, a new
  process at its first sample (A10: 2.1–2.4 µs per descriptor; every list at every sample would cost 14–16 ms on the
  reference fixture, review of e3882de); a socket whose process is not known yet is counted once it is. Another owner's
  process shows "—" (its descriptors cannot be read). A line under the
  table: "UDP traffic, such as some video, is counted only in the totals below."
- **AM44** Summary from `/proc/net/dev`, every interface except `lo`: Packets in, Packets out, Data received, Data sent
  (since boot) and per second; the graph shows Packets or Data (a pop-up, remembered).

### GPU (step 1 data, step 2 window)
- **AM45** GPU clients: each own process's DRM descriptors (`fd/` links to `/dev/dri/*`), found by the same turn as AM43
  (one tenth of the processes' descriptor lists per sample, a new process at its first sample); at each sample only the
  `fdinfo` of the DRM descriptors found is read: keys `drm-driver`, `drm-pdev`, `drm-client-id`, `drm-engine-<name>`,
  `drm-engine-capacity-<name>`, `drm-memory-<region>`; one client per (`drm-pdev`, `drm-client-id`) even when several
  descriptors share it.
- **AM46** Engine share of a client = Δ`drm-engine-<name>` (ns) ÷ (Δt × capacity); % GPU of a process = its busiest engine
  (Σ over its clients, capped at 100); GPU Time = Σ of its engines' times.
- **AM47** A system GPU's engine share = Σ over the user's clients on that `drm-pdev`, capped at 100 (the compositor is one of
  them); its name from `/sys/class/drm/card*/device` (vendor and device ids looked up in `/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids` when
  present, else "GPU <n>"), its driver from the `driver` link.
- **AM48** A driver without `drm-engine-*` keys gives "—" in % GPU and GPU Time, and no GPU in GPU History or Performance
  (verified on the owner's i915 at step 1, read-only).
- **AM49** Processes, by GPU (macOS 27): one group per GPU (`drm-pdev`) with its client processes; processes without a client
  are not listed in this view.

### Quit, Force Quit, signals (step 2; Quit of windowed processes through the shell at step 3)
- **AM50** Actions (Quit, Force Quit, Send Signal, Efficiency Mode) apply to own processes only: with another owner's row
  or the Kernel row in the selection they are disabled, the tooltip saying "You can only quit your own processes." (no
  administrator path, AQ4). Otherwise the Stop button, View > Quit Process (Ctrl+Alt+Q) and the row's context menu open the
  sheet "Are you sure you want
  to quit this process?" (several rows: "Are you sure you want to quit these %n processes?"), buttons Cancel, Force Quit,
  Quit; Quit is the default (Return), Esc cancels.
- **AM51** Before the sheet shows, the app opens `/proc/<pid>` as a directory descriptor (`O_DIRECTORY`) for each selected
  row, reads `stat` through it with `openat` and compares the start time with the row's; a row whose read fails (the process
  ended) or whose start time differs is dropped (none left: no sheet). The signal of AM52, AM53 or AM55 is sent with
  `pidfd_send_signal` on that same descriptor, which names one process for good: if it ended meanwhile the call fails with
  ESRCH (A2) and no other process can be hit (review of e3882de: a pidfd opened after the check left a gap). The
  descriptors are closed when the sheet closes.
- **AM52** Quit: a process owning windows (projection) → IPC `activity quit <pid>` to the shell (AM61); `ok` → nothing more
  (the app may ask to save); `no-windows` → `SIGTERM` through AM51's descriptor; `refused`, no answer within 1 s, or no projection
  for a process of an app unit → the sheet stays with "The process couldn't be quit safely." and only Cancel and Force
  Quit. A process without windows → `SIGTERM` through AM51's descriptor.
- **AM53** Force Quit → `SIGKILL` through AM51's descriptor. ESRCH (it ended) is silent; any other error shows "The process couldn't
  be quit." with the reason in the journal.
- **AM54** Session processes (AD22): the user's processes in units of `session.slice` or `session-graphical.slice`, in uwsm's
  `wayland-session-bindpid@*.service` (whatever its slice), in the login session's `session-<n>.scope` under
  `user-<uid>.slice`, or in the user manager's `init.scope` (review of e3882de: the bindpid unit and the login scope end the
  session too). Quit, Force Quit and Send Signal first show a second sheet "Quitting “%1” may end your session or stop part
  of it." (for a signal: "Sending a signal to “%1” may end your session or stop part of it."), buttons Cancel (the default)
  and Continue (destructive). The app refuses to signal itself from the table (its own row's Quit closes its window
  instead).
- **AM55** View > Send Signal to Process… (one row): a sheet with a pop-up of Hangup (SIGHUP), Interrupt (SIGINT), Quit
  (SIGQUIT), Abort (SIGABRT), Kill (SIGKILL), Alarm (SIGALRM), Terminate (SIGTERM), User Defined 1 (SIGUSR1), User Defined 2
  (SIGUSR2), Stop (SIGSTOP), Continue (SIGCONT); Cancel and Send; the descriptor path of AM51. For a session process AM54's
  second sheet comes before the signal, and Stop is not in the pop-up at all: a stopped compositor or shell freezes the
  screen and the lock before sleep (review of e3882de). Stop is not offered for the app itself either.
- **AM56** Dev guard (ADR-0019): in a dev session AM52 to AM55 and AM68 act only on processes descending from the nested
  compositor (its pid from the dev state) or named by a test fixture; any other is refused with one "dev guard" journal line
  and the sheet says "Development session: only the nested session's processes can be quit."

### Inspect (step 2)
- **AM57** Info button, double-click, View > Inspect Process (Ctrl+I): a window "<name> (<pid>)" per process (a second
  request raises it), refreshed at the update frequency while open. For another owner's process the window shows what
  `stat` and `status` give (the header, the Memory tab but Proportional Memory, Threads, CPU Time, Context Switches,
  Faults, Started, Nice) and "—" elsewhere; Open Files and Ports says "The open files of another user's process can't be
  read." and the Quit button is disabled. Header: Parent Process (name and pid; a click inspects
  it), Process Group (pgid), User, % CPU, Recent hangs (the number of times the projection marked it since the app opened).
- **AM58** Tabs: **Memory** (Real Memory Size, Virtual Memory Size, Shared Memory Size, Private Memory Size, Proportional
  Memory Size from `smaps_rollup` `Pss` read at most every 5 s, Swapped, Peak); **Statistics** (Threads, CPU Time user and
  system, Context Switches voluntary and involuntary summed over the threads, Faults minor and major, Read and Write calls
  from `io` `syscr`/`syscw`, Started (date and time), Nice, Scheduler policy, Unit (the systemd unit), Command, Executable
  (`exe`), Working Folder (`cwd`)); **Open Files and Ports** (one line per descriptor: a file's path, a pipe, a TCP or UDP
  socket with local and remote address and port from `/proc/net/{tcp,tcp6,udp,udp6}` by inode, a local socket's path from
  `/proc/net/unix`, or the kernel's own name such as `anon_inode:[eventfd]`). A value the kernel refuses is "—".
- **AM59** Buttons: Quit (AM50's sheet for this process). No Sample button. Environment variables are never read.

### The shell (step 3)
- **AM60** Projection: while a toplevel with app id `org.grassfield.Activity` exists on its display, the shell writes
  `windows.json` in the runtime folder (folder 0700, file 0600, written to a temporary name then renamed):
  `{"v":1,"writer":{"pid":N,"start":N},"windows":[{"pid":N,"app":"<app id>","idleInhibit":bool}…],"notResponding":[N…]}`,
  at most 256 windows, from `Compositor.knownWindows()` after `Compositor.refreshToplevels()` on a window opening, closing or
  changing class, and from `NotResponding.marks`, coalesced over 250 ms. No title. The file is removed when the last such
  toplevel closes and when the shell stops. The app reads it on change (inotify) and ignores it when stale (Terms: writer)
  or invalid (over 64 KiB, another `v`, a value of the wrong type).
- **AM61** IPC target `activity`, function `quit(pid: int): string`, class action, caller `grassfield-activity`: refused
  (`refused`) for a pid ≤ 1 or in a dev session for a pid outside the nested session; otherwise refreshes the toplevels,
  closes every window whose client pid is `pid` (`Compositor.close`, as the Dock's Quit) and answers `ok`, or `no-windows`
  when there was none. Never kills. Listed in `docs/specs/security.md` "IPC surface" and `tests/security/ipc_inventory.sh`.
- **AM62** Dock tile graph: View > Dock Icon: Show Application Icon (default), Show Network Usage, Show Disk Activity, Show
  CPU Usage, Show CPU History. Other than the icon, the app writes `dock-tile.json` in the runtime folder (0600, renamed
  into place) at each sample: `{"v":1,"writer":{"pid":N,"start":N},"kind":"network|disk|cpu-usage|cpu-history",
  "samples":[…]}`, at most 32 samples, each a number or a pair in [0, 1] the app has scaled (network and disk: in and out over
  the window's maximum; CPU usage: one value, drawn as a 10-segment gauge; CPU history: pairs System and User), at most 2
  KiB. The Dock reads only its own display's runtime folder (a nested session's file never reaches the real Dock, review of
  e3882de), only for the `org.grassfield.Activity` tile while it is running; it rejects a file over 2 KiB, a `v` other than
  1, an unknown kind, a value out of range or a stale writer, and draws the graph over the tile with tokens
  (`dock.tileGraph*`), the running dot and badge unchanged. The app removes the file when the icon is chosen and when it
  quits.
- **AM63** End Task (owner, AQ5; AD27): Settings > Desktop & Dock gains the switch "Show End Task in Dock menus" (fr
  « Afficher Fin de tâche dans les menus du Dock »), key `dock.endTask` in `grassfield.json` (boolean, default false; schema
  and settings contract). While it is on, the Dock menu of a running app (not the Files tile, a folder or the Trash) shows
  "End Task" (fr « Fin de tâche ») right after Quit (or after Force Quit when the app does not respond); it runs the menu's
  existing Option + Force Quit: the confirmation "Force quit “%1”?", then `Power.run("forcequit")` on every process of the
  app. With Option held, the menu shows Force Quit as today and no End Task (the two would do the same). The Force Quit panel
  is unchanged.
- **AM64** Ctrl+Shift+Esc (owner, AQ6; AD28): `bind("CTRL + SHIFT + ESCAPE", "Activity Monitor", launch("activity"))` in
  `config/hypr/grassfield/bindings.lua`; `packaging/bin/grassfield-launch-key` gains the kind `activity`
  (`org.grassfield.Activity.desktop`, through `uwsm app`, its own scope; nothing in a nested dev session, as its other kinds);
  a running app comes to the front (AM1). The shortcut is listed with the others in Settings' keyboard shortcuts.

### From Windows 11 (step 4)
- **AM65** Processes, by Type (AD26): groups with a count in their header, in this order: Apps, Background Processes,
  Session Processes (each for own processes), System Processes (system accounts and the Kernel row), Other Users (only
  when such a process runs). An own process is a Session process per AM54; else it is in Apps when its unit is under
  `app-graphical.slice` or it owns a window (projection); else in Background Processes. Apps has one sub-group per unit.
  Unit names (AD20, review of e3882de): `app-<desktop>-<name>-<8 hex>.scope` or `app-<desktop>-<name>@<8 hex>.service`,
  split at "-" and "@" (an escaped part holds neither: uwsm writes "-" as `\x2d`), `<name>` unescaped (`\xNN` to its byte);
  the sub-group's name and icon come from the window's app id, else the desktop entry whose id is `<name>` (a launch by
  desktop entry), else the one whose `Exec` basename is `<name>`, else `<name>` itself, sanitized as AM17.
- **AM66** Performance window (Window > Performance, Ctrl+5): a sidebar with one row per resource (CPU; Memory; each
  physical disk; each network interface but `lo`, Wi-Fi or Ethernet from `/sys/class/net/<if>/wireless` and `type`; each GPU
  with clients), each with a small live graph and its current value; the selected resource's large graph (`activity.
  historySamples` samples) and details:
  - CPU: Overall or Logical Processors (one small graph per `cpuN` line of `/proc/stat`, a pop-up), Utilization, Speed (mean
    `scaling_cur_freq`), Base Speed (`base_frequency` when present), Processes, Threads, Up Time (`/proc/uptime`), Cores and
    Logical Processors (`topology/`), L1, L2, L3 caches (`cache/index*/size`).
  - Memory: In Use, Available, Committed (`Committed_AS` of `CommitLimit`), Cached, Compressed, Swap Used, and a composition
    bar (In Use, Compressed, Cached, Free).
  - Disk: Active Time (Δ field 13 ÷ Δt), Read Speed, Write Speed, Average Response Time (Δ(fields 7 + 11) ÷ Δ(fields 4 + 8)),
    Capacity (`size` × 512), Type (SSD or HDD from `queue/rotational`), Model (`device/model`).
  - Network: Send and Receive throughput (two series), Interface, Kind, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (`getifaddrs`), and for Wi-Fi
    the network's name from NetworkManager (system bus, read-only) and the signal from `/proc/net/wireless`.
  - GPU: one graph per engine (AM47), memory per region where `drm-memory-*` reports it, Driver.
- **AM67** App History window (Window > App History, Ctrl+6): a period pop-up (Last 12 Hours (default), Last 7 Days, Last 30
  Days) and a line "Resource use since <date> for <user>"; rows per app: name and icon, CPU Time, Memory Peak, Launches, Last
  Used; sortable. Source, read when the window opens and on the period's change: `journalctl --user -o json
  MESSAGE_ID=ae8f7b866b0347b9af31fe1c80b127c0 --since <start>` (records of the units AM65 names, under
  `app-graphical.slice`; fields `CPU_USAGE_NSEC` and `MEMORY_PEAK` as systemd 262 writes them, A6, checked on the owner's
  journal at step 4, read-only), plus each live app unit's `cpu.stat` `usage_usec`. Apps match AM65's naming. Nothing can be
  deleted (the journal is the system's record; Windows' "Delete usage history" is not offered, AD31, review of e3882de). No
  journal access (an error from `journalctl`) shows "Usage history isn't available." and nothing else.
- **AM68** Efficiency Mode (View menu, action menu, context menu; a checked item for the selected process): available only
  for an own process in a unit uwsm named for one launch under `app-graphical.slice` (AM65's names, with the random suffix),
  never a Session process (AM54) or a long-lived user service (its runtime drop-in would outlive a restart, review of
  e3882de). It sets the unit's CPU weight to the lowest systemd accepts (`CPUWeight=idle` where supported, else 1) with
  `org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager.SetUnitProperties(unit, runtime=true, …)` on the session bus, and the unset value to
  turn it off. The first time, a sheet "Turn on Efficiency Mode for “%1”?" explains that the whole app runs at the lowest
  priority when the computer is busy, with "Don't ask again" (remembered), Cancel and Turn On. Status shows "Efficiency
  Mode" for every process of that unit while the unit's `cpu.weight` (read from its cgroup) is the low value, so a change
  made elsewhere shows too. Unavailable items are disabled with the reason in their tooltip ("This process isn't running as
  an app.", "This process is part of your session."). Side effect (ADR-0038 g): the first weight set makes systemd enable
  the `cpu` controller in `app.slice` and `app-graphical.slice`, so contended apps then share the processor app by app;
  step 4 records whether systemd turns it off again when no weight is set.
- **AM69** Window > Login Items… opens Settings on General > Login Items (`grassfield-settings --section=login` through the
  shell's launch path or `uwsm-app`); nothing of that pane is in the app.
- **AM70** Status column and Copy: AM27, AM19.

### Small windows (step 5)
- **AM71** Window > CPU Usage (Ctrl+2): a small window with one vertical bar per logical processor, current share,
  System and User stacked.
- **AM72** Window > CPU History (Ctrl+3): one small graph per logical processor; Window > GPU History (Ctrl+4): one graph per
  GPU (AM47); View > Clear CPU History (Ctrl+K) empties the CPU graphs.
- **AM73** Window > Keep CPU Windows on Top: those windows carry a toplevel tag the Grassfield session's Hyprland rules pin
  above other windows (AD23); without the rule the item is absent.

### Persistence, degraded behaviour, dev (every step)
- **AM74** `activity.json` (state, version 1, written by the app only, ADR-0020 row): window frames, tab, view, columns,
  widths and sort per tab, graph pop-ups, update frequency, Dock icon, "Don't ask again", App History's period. An unknown
  version or a broken file is set aside (renamed `.bad`) and defaults are used.
- **AM75** No shell: no projection (no "(Not Responding)", no Windowed Processes view, Quit as AM52), no Dock graph; everything
  else works.
- **AM76** No systemd user manager on the session bus: Efficiency Mode absent; App History shows AM67's message.
- **AM77** No UPower: AM39's battery part absent.
- **AM78** No `/proc/pressure`: AM33's fallback.
- **AM79** Fixture tree (tests only): in a dev session, `GRASSFIELD_PROC_ROOT` and `GRASSFIELD_SYS_ROOT` (dev plumbing,
  `runmode.h` `devValue`) point the sampler at a fixture tree; outside a dev session they are ignored.

## Keyboard
| Keys | Action |

| Ctrl+F | focus the search field (Esc clears it) |
| Ctrl+I | Inspect the selected process |
| Ctrl+Alt+Q | Quit Process (the sheet) |
| Ctrl+C, Ctrl+A | Copy, Select All |
| Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+6 | the main window, CPU Usage, CPU History, GPU History, Performance, App History |

Shortcuts follow the other Grassfield apps' Ctrl-for-Command mapping and the menu shortcut style of ADR-0024 (symbols on a
Mac keyboard, text on a PC).

## Accessibility
- Table: role table, rows with role row and a name made of the process name and the visible values ("Firefox, 12.4 percent
  CPU, 1.2 gigabytes"), headers as column headers with their sort state.
- Graphs: an accessible name with the current values ("CPU load: system 8 percent, user 22 percent"), updated at most every
  5 s for screen readers.
- Sheets: focus on the default button; destructive buttons named as such. Every control keyboard-reachable with a visible
  focus ring (A1).
- Colour is never the only cue: "(Not Responding)" is text; the pressure level is also in the graph's accessible name and a
  label ("Memory pressure: normal, high, critical").

## i18n (en and fr)
Every visible string through `qsTr()`; fr complete (I1). French follows macOS's: tabs « Processeur », « Mémoire »,
« Énergie », « Disque », « Réseau »; « Quitter », « Forcer à quitter », « Pression de la mémoire », « Mémoire physique »,
« Mémoire utilisée », « Mémoire de l'app », « Mémoire résidente » (Wired), « Compressée », « Fichiers en cache », « Swap
utilisé »; « (ne répond pas) » as the Force Quit panel. Sizes and times in the locale's format.

## Refusals (what is refused, and what the user sees)
| Case | What the user sees |
|---|---|
| A process of another owner, or the Kernel row (AQ4) | actions disabled; tooltip "You can only quit your own processes."; "—" where the kernel refuses a read; no command line |
| A read the kernel refuses | "—" in that cell |
| Quit of a windowed process without the shell | AM52's message; Force Quit offered |
| A session process | AM54's second sheet before Quit, Force Quit or any signal; no Stop in Send Signal (AM55) |
| Efficiency Mode outside an app unit or for a session process | the item disabled, AM68's reasons |
| The app's own row | Quit closes its window; Force Quit and signals refused ("This app can't force quit itself.") |
| Dev session, a process outside the nested session | AM56's message |

## Acceptance criteria (each mapped to a test; level)
| ID | Criterion | Test | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-S1 | every formula of AM20 to AM47 on fixture `/proc` and `/sys` trees, including "—" cases and first-sample rates | `tests/unit/activity/tst_sampler.cpp` (gtest) | L0 |
| A-S2 | owners (own, system account, other user), the Kernel row, the My/System/Other views, other owners' "—" cells and hidden command lines, row identity across pid reuse | `tst_sampler.cpp` (fixture trees with three uids) | L0 |
| A-S2b | the same against the real kernel: a process of another uid (a test container with two users, as the probes) shows its CPU and memory, "—" for disk, and every action is refused | `tests/apps/activity_owners.sh` (container only) | L1 |
| A-S3 | AM33's levels at each threshold; AM32's sum; AM34's naming | `tst_memory.cpp` | L0 |
| A-S4 | AM54's and AM65's classification of fixture cgroup paths: a uwsm scope and a uwsm service in `app-graphical.slice` (Apps), `session.slice`, `session-graphical.slice`, `init.scope`, `wayland-session-bindpid@1234.service` in `background.slice` and a login `session-3.scope` (Session), `app.slice` services (Background); unit names from a desktop id and from a command with `\x2d` escapes, unescaped and matched (AD20) | `tst_kinds.cpp` | L0 |
| A-S5 | sock_diag parsing and socket-to-process matching (captured netlink replies) | `tst_netdiag.cpp` | L0 |
| A-S6 | AM51's path: `stat` read through the `/proc/<pid>` descriptor; a child that ended and was reaped between the check and the send is never signalled (ESRCH), even when a new process has taken its pid (a pid-reuse fixture); a start-time mismatch drops the row | `tst_signals.cpp` | L0 |
| A-S7 | projection and Dock tile file validation (sizes, versions, kinds, ranges, a stale writer by pid or by start time); the runtime folder of two displays (a nested display's files never read by the other) | `tst_activityfiles.cpp` (app) and `tests/unit/tst_docktilegraph.qml` (shell) | L0 |
| A-S8 | AM17's names: another owner's `argv[0]` title never shown (its `stat` name instead); control and format characters (bidirectional overrides and isolates, zero-width characters) removed from names and command lines | `tst_names.cpp` | L0 |
| A-S9 | AM23's and AM43's turns: one fifth of the threads and one tenth of the descriptor lists per sample, a new process at once, every process covered within five and ten samples | `tst_sampler.cpp` | L0 |
| A-W1 | the window: tabs, columns chooser, sort, search, views, Copy text, offscreen | `tests/apps/activity_window.sh` | L1 |
| A-W2 | Quit sheet → `SIGTERM` for a windowless fixture, Force Quit → `SIGKILL`, ESRCH silent; Send Signal to a fixture classified as a session process shows the second sheet and offers no Stop | `tests/apps/activity_actions.sh` | L1 |
| A-N1 | nested: a SIGSTOP'd foot shows "(Not Responding)" (the ANR stand-in path of ADR-0035), Quit through the shell closes a foot window, the Dock tile graph draws and goes at quit | `tests/apps/activity_nested.sh` + `just shot activity` | L1 |
| A-N2 | dev guard: an action on a process outside the nested session is refused | `activity_nested.sh` | L1 |
| A-I1 | `ipc_inventory.sh` lists `activity quit` and finds its caller: its real-session caller scan (today `config/hypr/grassfield/`, `packaging/bin/`, `packaging/shims/`, `packaging/session-bin/` and the screen corners, `ipc_inventory.sh:850`) is extended to the apps' sources that build `shellIpcArgs()` calls (review of e3882de) | `tests/security/ipc_inventory.sh` | L0 |
| A-D1 | End Task: absent while `dock.endTask` is off, after Quit when on, absent with Option held and on the Files tile, folders and the Trash; the same confirmation and pids as Option + Force Quit | `tests/unit/tst_docklaunch.qml` (with `Launch.js`) and a new `tests/unit/tst_dockmenu.qml` for the menu model | L0 |
| A-K1 | `grassfield-launch-key activity` starts the desktop id through uwsm, nothing in a nested dev session; the binding exists once | `tests/shell/launch_keys.sh`, `tests/shell/session_input.sh` | L0 |
| A-P | AM-P1 to AM-P4, per tab | `tests/apps/activity_cost.sh` | L1 (and L2 on the owner's machine) |
| A-E | Efficiency Mode on a test scope (`systemd-run --user --scope --unit=grassfield-test-…`) sets and reverts the weight | `tests/apps/activity_efficiency.sh` (L2: the owner's user manager; refuses to run outside it) | L2 |
| A-H | App History on a fixture journal export | `tst_history.cpp` | L0 |

## Interfaces / contracts (versions)
- `activity-<display>/windows.json` v1 (AM60) and `activity-<display>/dock-tile.json` v1 (AM62) in the runtime folder: new,
  between the shell and the app; a breaking change bumps `v` and needs ADR-0038 amended.
- IPC `activity quit` (AM61): `docs/specs/security.md` "IPC surface".
- `activity.json` v1 (AM74): ADR-0020.
- Read-only D-Bus: logind `ListInhibitors`, UPower (DisplayDevice, `GetHistory`), NetworkManager (active connection name);
  read-write: the systemd user manager `SetUnitProperties` (runtime only, AM68).
- Kernel interfaces: `/proc/<pid>/{stat,status,io,cmdline,cgroup,fd,fdinfo,task,smaps_rollup,exe,cwd}`, `/proc/{stat,
  meminfo,loadavg,uptime,diskstats,swaps,pressure/memory}`, `/proc/net/{dev,tcp,tcp6,udp,udp6,unix,wireless}`, `/sys/block`,
  `/sys/class/{drm,net}`, `/sys/devices/system/cpu`, `NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG`, `pidfd_send_signal` on a `/proc/<pid>`
  descriptor (Linux ≥ 5.1).

## Dependencies (verified versions)
Qt 6 (Core, Gui, Qml, Quick, DBus; as Settings and the Store), Grassfield.Ui, glibc (`getifaddrs`, `syscall`), the kernel
(6.18.44 in the probes), systemd 262 and uwsm 0.27.1 (A6, A7; the owner's versions checked at step 1), `journalctl`.
No new package.

## Degraded behavior
AM75 to AM78; a kernel without `pidfd_send_signal` (older than 5.1) is not supported by Omarchy 4 and is not handled.

## Automated tests · Manual verification steps
Automated: the table above. Manual (owner, L2): AM36's calibration on the laptop; AM39 on battery and on AC; AM43 with a
download in a browser (TCP) and a video (QUIC, only in the totals); AM48 on i915; AM-P1 to AM-P4 on the real session;
Efficiency Mode on a real app with a CPU load (`stress-ng` once installed by the owner) to see its share fall under
contention.

## Performance (gates; one threshold per tab, from ADR-0038 A10, review of e3882de)
The reference fixture is A10's: about 600 processes (400 of the user with 4 threads and about 17 descriptors each, 200 of
another user), about 1 600 threads, 6 800 descriptors and 220 TCP sockets. The thresholds below are A10's worst run plus
about 30 %, on the cloud machine that ran it; step 1 runs the same fixture on the reference machine (i5-10400H) and the
integrator sets them again from those numbers if they differ. Each is measured per tab, the window visible on that tab.

| Tab | One sample (AM-P2), sampler thread's CPU time | A10 worst run | App CPU at Normally (5 sec) (AM-P1) | App CPU at Very Often (1 sec) (AM-P1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPU | ≤ 6 ms | 4.7 ms | ≤ 0.5 % of one core | ≤ 1.5 % |
| Memory | ≤ 10 ms | 7.7 ms | ≤ 0.5 % | ≤ 1.5 % |
| Energy | ≤ 13 ms | 10.3 ms | ≤ 0.5 % | ≤ 2 % |
| Disk | ≤ 7 ms | 5.1 ms | ≤ 0.5 % | ≤ 1.5 % |
| Network | ≤ 7 ms | 5.2 ms | ≤ 0.5 % | ≤ 1.5 % |

- **AM-P1** The app's whole CPU (Δ utime + stime of its own `stat` over 10 minutes, sampler and window together) with the
  window visible on the tab, at the rates above.
- **AM-P2** One sample, read as ADR-0038 d says (the listing, `stat`, the tab's own reads, the turns of AM23 and AM43); the
  dev build counts each kind of read so the test can tell which one went over.
- **AM-P3** Minimized: no per-process sample (counted by a dev counter); with a Dock graph at 5 s, ≤ 0.1 % of one core.
- **AM-P4** Memory: the app's PSS ≤ 120 MB after 10 minutes, and its growth over one hour < 5 MB.
- The shell: the projection writer and the Dock graph add no measurable CPU at idle (P1) and are measured during a window
  storm (20 windows opened and closed).
Method: `tests/apps/activity_cost.sh` builds the fixture (as `sampcost spawn` and `sampcost tcp` do), starts the app
(offscreen and nested), switches through the tabs at both rates, samples its `/proc/<pid>/stat` and `smaps_rollup` and its
dev read counters, and fails over a threshold; results recorded in the step's audit file. A real session is measured again
at step 5 (L2), with its own number of processes, threads and descriptors noted beside the results.

## Known limitations (honest, user-visible gaps vs macOS)
- Other owners' processes are read-only (AQ4): no administrator path to quit them (macOS asks for an administrator), and
  their disk, network, GPU, open files and command line are not shown.
- Time the kernel spends on interrupts belongs to no process: System is a little above the sum of the rows.
- Network per process is TCP only and starts when the app opens (AQ2); UDP, including QUIC video, is only in the totals.
- Energy Impact is Grassfield's own estimate (AQ3); no 12 hr Power, App Nap or Graphics Card.
- No Sample Process, Spindump or System Diagnostics.
- Wake Ups count voluntary context switches, not package wake-ups from idle, and each process's value is refreshed every
  fifth sample (AM23).
- GPU figures need a driver that reports `drm-engine-*`; another user's GPU use is not seen.
- The app quits with its last window, so the Dock graph lasts while a window is open or minimized (macOS keeps it running).
- Efficiency Mode lowers a whole app's CPU weight, only under contention, only until the app quits or the session ends, and
  not its disk priority (the `io` controller is not delegated to the user manager). Only apps started in their own unit
  can use it. Once used, contended apps may share the processor app by app until logout (AM68).
- App History covers apps started in their own scope (from the Dock, Apps, Search or a uwsm launch), from systemd's records
  of apps that ended plus the running ones, as far back as the journal keeps them; it cannot be deleted from the app.
- A new socket or GPU client of a process already listed is seen within ten samples (AM43, AM45).
- A process that ended between two samples moves its last slice of CPU to System.
