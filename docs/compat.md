# Compatibility matrix

Compare these with the installed versions at the start of every session (master-prompt §13).
If Hyprland or Quickshell changed: rebuild the plugin and run the C2 degradation test first.

| Component | Version | Verified | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| Omarchy | 4.0.4 (package; `/usr/share/omarchy/version` says `4.0.0.alpha`) | 2026-10-17 | `pacman -Q omarchy`, `/etc/os-release` |
| Hyprland | 0.56.2 (commit efb50993, tag v0.56.2) | 2026-10-17 | `hyprctl version` |

## Known upstream issues (observed, not caused by Grassfield)
| Component | Issue | Evidence | Impact / mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hyprland 0.56.2 | SIGSEGV during process exit in `Screenshare::CScreenshareManager` destructor (`CScreenshareSession::~CScreenshareSession` → `screenshareEvents`) when a toplevel capture session is still active | `coredumpctl info 89926` (nested instance, 2026-10-17 02:56, Overview live thumbnails active at compositor exit); no grassfield-compositor frames in the stack | Only at compositor exit (logout). Overview stops captures when it closes; leaves a core dump if the session ends while Overview is open. Report upstream (owner decision). |
| Quickshell 0.3.1 (Arch build, Qt 6.11.2) | SIGSEGV in libc under `Qt::endPropertyUpdateGroup()` ← two unsymbolized quickshell frames ← `QAbstractSocketPrivate::canReadNotification()`, i.e. while a socket read handler applies a batched property update; seen about 1 s after a shell restart in a nested session, right after `quickshell.service.polkit.listener: failed to register listener ... An authentication agent already exists` | Two identical crash stacks (Quickshell crash reporter, 2026-10-21 23:4x, nested dev sessions); 1/10 restarts on main 72176a1, 1/10 and 2/12 on a Dock branch; no Grassfield code in the stack | Nested dev only so far (the polkit agent registers normally in the real session). Owner: watch for "Quickshell crashed" in the real session. Upstream report needs symbols (debuginfod) to name the socket owner, likely the Hyprland IPC event socket. |

## Omarchy dependencies (GF-AUDIT-001, 02 §5.5; remediation of F2, F5, F6, F7)

Grassfield is a separate session over Omarchy (ADR-0001). It reads Omarchy's files and runs a few of its commands; it modifies
none of them and none of the owner's dotfiles. **`scripts/dev/omarchy-compat.sh`** (`just check-omarchy`, also run by
`tests/shell/omarchy_compat.sh`) checks every row below against the installed Omarchy and exits 1 when one is gone or changed
in the way Grassfield relies on. Run it after every Omarchy update (done from the Omarchy session, see below) and before a release.
`/usr/share/omarchy/version` is a stale upstream file (`4.0.0.alpha` at every tag): the include no longer reads it; the gate is the
presence of the modules in the first rows.

| Dependency | Used by | If it disappears |
|---|---|---|
| `$OMARCHY_PATH/default/hypr/{helpers,envs,paths,require_optional,nvidia}.lua`, global `o` | `config/hypr/grassfield/omarchy.lua` (environment, Wayland toolkit variables, GPU variables, PATH) | include skipped, one critical notification at start, journal line `grassfield: Omarchy include`; Grassfield defaults apply |
| `default/hypr/input.lua` (layout from `/etc/vconsole.conf`, `compose:caps`, repeat 40/250, numlock; GF-023) | same | the same defaults are reproduced by the fallback in `omarchy.lua` and one notification says so |
| `~/.config/hypr/{monitors,input}.lua` (owner's files, read only) | same | a failing file is reported, the others still load |
| `bin/omarchy-restart-shell`, `bin/omarchy-launch-shell` and the call chain `omarchy-update-restart` → `omarchy-restart-shell` (GF-032) | shadowed by `/usr/lib/grassfield/omarchy-shims/` (first in PATH: `omarchy.lua` guard_path, `packaging/uwsm/env-grassfield`) | if Omarchy renames them the check fails: the stand-ins no longer cover the update |
| `bin/omarchy-hook`, `omarchy-powerprofiles-init`, `omarchy-powerprofiles-set` | `autostart.lua` (post-boot hooks, power profile at start) | skipped (guarded by `command -v`) |
| `bin/omarchy-migrate` (`--pending`), `omarchy-launch-floating-terminal-with-presentation` | `grassfield-migrate-notify` | no migrations notice |
| user unit `omarchy-sleep-lock` (delay inhibitor, `PrepareForSleep` monitor; `omarchy-system-sleep-lock` calls `omarchy-shell lock lock` and polls `omarchy-shell lock status`) | D-12 fail-safe: drop-in `ExecCondition=/usr/lib/grassfield/sleep-lock-gate` (skipped while grassfield-shell runs), started by `OnFailure=` of grassfield-shell; its `omarchy-shell` calls reach the stand-in in `omarchy-shims`, which starts grassfield-shell again and asks it to lock (docs/specs/security.md "Lock coverage") | renamed unit: no fail-safe after a shell failure; a changed `lock status` JSON contract: Omarchy keeps asking, then reports that the screen did not lock |
| `bin/omarchy-hyprland-monitor-watch` (Omarchy's autostart: clamshell sync on monitor events, and `omarchy-hyprland-monitor-modeless`: an enabled monitor at 0x0, a monitor that answered no video modes, recovered by reloads with a back-off) | not run in the Grassfield session: the clamshell part is `grassfield-lid reconcile` on `monitor.added`/`monitor.removed` (`system.lua`); the recovery is `shell/platform/Displays.qml` `checkModeless` (`DisplaysFile.modeless`, the same rule; a reload through `SessionConfig` after 3 s, doubled up to 60 s, until every display has a mode; the owner's rc6 report: external displays black after sleep until unplugged). `scripts/dev/omarchy-compat.sh` pins the rule | nothing: the recovery is Grassfield's own; a changed rule upstream is reported by the compat check |
| user units `omarchy-crash-watch`, `omarchy-migrate-notify`, `omarchy-update-user-notify` | drop-ins `/usr/lib/systemd/user/<unit>.service.d/10-grassfield.conf` (`ConditionEnvironment=!GRASSFIELD_SESSION=1`) | a renamed unit runs in both sessions and needs the Omarchy shell (check fails; the other `omarchy-*.service` units are listed as info) |
| user unit `bt-agent` (`bt-agent -c NoInputNoOutput`, Omarchy's pairing agent) | drop-in `/usr/lib/systemd/user/bt-agent.service.d/10-grassfield.conf` (`ConditionEnvironment=!GRASSFIELD_SESSION=1`): grassfield-prompter is bluetoothd's only agent in the session (ADR-0035 D-11, decision 10-1) | renamed: a second agent answers pairings in the Grassfield session without asking (check fails); gone: nothing (info) |
| PAM services `omarchy-lock-password` (+ optional `omarchy-lock-fingerprint`), generated by `omarchy-apply-lock` | `shell/security/lock/Lock.qml` | the lock refuses and stays locked (fails closed) |
| `/usr/local/share/wayland-sessions/omarchy.desktop` (fallback `hyprland-uwsm.desktop`) | `grassfield-login set omarchy` starts its `Exec` line | login falls back to Grassfield |
| SDDM theme `omarchy`: `Main.qml` picks the first session whose name contains `uwsm`; no session list (GF-015) | `/etc/sddm.conf.d/grassfield.conf` (SessionDir, autologin session), entry `Grassfield (uwsm)` | the check fails; `grassfield-login-check` explains |
| `/usr/share/uwsm/env.d/10-omarchy` (OMARCHY_PATH, TERMINAL, EDITOR, mise) | both sessions through uwsm | information only |
| `gpu-screen-recorder` (Omarchy base package; arguments after `bin/omarchy-capture-screenrecording`, pinned) | `packaging/bin/grassfield-capture record` (ADR-0045 OC-1); the shell asks `command -v` each time the capture toolbar opens | the toolbar's Record buttons are hidden; the helper exits 3 and runs nothing |
| `uwsm-app` (Omarchy's uwsm) | `shell/services/CaptureState.qml` (the capture helper in its own scope, as app launches) | the helper runs unscoped, inside grassfield-shell's unit |
| `tesseract` (+ `tesseract-data-eng`; French needs `tesseract-data-fra`), `zbarimg` (`zbar`), Omarchy base packages; options after `bin/omarchy-capture-text`, `bin/omarchy-capture-qr` (pinned) | Preview and Glance: text and QR codes in images (ADR-0045 OC-2; `apps/preview/src/previewlogic.cpp`, `previewapp.cpp`) | no text selection or no QR chip, nothing on screen, one journal line (`grassfield-preview: tesseract is not installed…`, `…zbarimg is not installed…`, `…no tesseract language data…`) |
| `$OMARCHY_PATH/shell/plugins/emojis/emojis.json` (1870 `{e, k}` entries in v4.0.6, Unicode order; the group-first glyphs 😀 👋 🐵 🍇 🌍 🎃 👓 🏧 🏁 in that order) | Emoji & Symbols (ADR-0045 OC-3; `shell/services/Emoji.qml`, `EmojiLogic.categories`), read at the first opening | missing, unreadable or empty: the panel says "Emoji list not available"; a group-first glyph moved: one "All" section and a journal line |

| `bin/omarchy-brightness-display-ddc` (`<monitor>` prints 0..100 and exits 0, exit 1 without DDC; `<monitor> N%`, `+N%`, `N%-` print the level set, 1..100; cache under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), through `ddcutil` (base package), always run as `timeout -k 2 12 omarchy-brightness-display-ddc …` (coreutils: the whole group ends, ddcutil included) | brightness keys, OSD and Quick Settings (`shell/services/Brightness.qml`, `BrightnessLogic.js`), Settings > Displays (`apps/settings/qml/System.js`; write guarded in `systemguard.cpp`) (ADR-0045 OC-4, pinned) | one journal line; keys drive the backlight or nothing; Quick Settings' Display module hidden on a desktop; no Settings row. No i2c access: the display is marked without DDC |

What Grassfield provides itself where Omarchy's version needs the Omarchy shell (audit 02 §5.3): crash notifications
(`grassfield-crash-watch.service`: the macOS model, "<App> quit unexpectedly" with Reopen only when a crashed application of the
user is gone: a trusted systemd-coredump entry for an app scope whose cgroup is gone or empty within 10 s; a tool crashing in a
terminal, a helper of a running app, a service and the shell give no notice, the journal keeps every dump; rules in the header
of `packaging/bin/grassfield-crash-watch`, tests in `tests/shell/crash_watch.sh`), low battery at 20/10/5 % (`grassfield-battery-watch.service`), a clickable migrations notice
(`grassfield-migrate-notify.service`; Omarchy's click command travels in a private hint, `omarchy-exec-argv`, that Grassfield's
server does not run, on purpose: any program could otherwise name a command), removable media (`grassfield-automount.service`,
udiskie), Night Shift (`grassfield-nightshift on|off|toggle|status`, hyprsunset; the Control Center switch is shell work),
screenshots (Super+Shift+3/4/5), lid and clamshell (`grassfield-lid`), graceful Log Out / Restart / Shut Down
(`grassfield-session-end`), the keyboard defaults, post-boot hooks and the power profile at start.
Omarchy capabilities Grassfield uses through Omarchy's own commands, packages and data (ADR-0045; rows in the table below):
screen recording in the capture toolbar (gpu-screen-recorder), text and QR codes in images (tesseract, zbar), Emoji & Symbols
(Omarchy's emoji list and insert command), external display brightness (DDC/CI), dictation (voxtype), fingerprint and security
key, Remote Login, disk encryption password and hibernation setups (Omarchy's scripts in Omarchy's terminal), Wi-Fi sharing
by QR code, terminal themes that follow the appearance, per-application window rules, LocalSend, weather. Clipboard history
is Grassfield's own (ADR-0034). Deferred to M6 (ADR-0045 OC-15): factory reset and first-run provisioning.
Not provided (Omarchy features without a macOS counterpart): Omarchy menu, tmux/herdr key menus, 1Password lock on lock.

### Updating Omarchy with Grassfield installed
Run the Omarchy update from the **Omarchy session** (or a TTY): it restarts the Omarchy shell at its end and Omarchy's
pacman hooks reload every Hyprland instance. In a Grassfield session the restart step is shadowed by a no-op
(`tests/shell/omarchy_guard.sh`), so a forgotten update in a Grassfield terminal does no harm, but the Omarchy shell is not
restarted either and `grassfield-shell` is not touched (log out and in to restart it). A reload from Omarchy's hooks still
reaches the Grassfield instance: `grassfield.core` clears its modules and a new Lua state loads the config again (T-OM4 in
the audit: verify in the nested session). After the update: `just check-omarchy`,
`Hyprland --verify-config --config /usr/share/grassfield/hypr/session.lua`, and after a Hyprland upgrade rebuild the plugin
first (ABI hash above).

### Pending for Omarchy 4.0.6 (Qt 6.12, Quickshell 0.3.2): UNVERIFIED here
Omarchy stable is 4.0.6 (installed: 4.0.4); 4.0.5 moves the system to Qt 6.12 and Quickshell 0.3.2. None of this has run on
Grassfield: take a snapshot, update, then run `just test`, `just check-omarchy --require`, the lock and polkit security tests
and the owner L2 list. The lock fixes of 4.0.5/4.0.6 (stale `locked` binding before suspend, stranded-lock takeover) are in
Omarchy's plugin, of which Grassfield's `shell/security/lock/Lock.qml` is an adapted fork (review item for the security
owner; no upstream commit is pinned in the file header).

### Omarchy 4.5.0 supported, 4.0.6 stays the minimum (platform work of 2026-11-05)
Omarchy's stable mirror serves omarchy 4.5.0-3 with Hyprland 0.56.2-4, quickshell 0.3.2.r7 and qt6-base 6.12.0-3 unchanged, so no
rebuild of the compositor plugin or the shell is implied. Both versions are supported by the same code. What changed, and what
Grassfield did (each line has a test; `GRASSFIELD_TEST_OMARCHY_ALT=<a 4.5.0 checkout>` runs the version-dependent ones on that tree):

| 4.5.0 change | Effect on Grassfield | Done |
|---|---|---|
| `omarchy-update-keyring` refreshes `omarchy-keyring` (and Arch ARM and platform keyrings) | the update helper refreshed only `archlinux-keyring` | the helper refreshes each installed keyring, failing closed; ARM and platform keyrings are not ported (x86_64 only) |
| `omarchy-update-system-pkgs` goes through `omarchy-update-pacman` (a systemd scope, `OMARCHY_UPDATE_PACMAN=1`) | none: the helper already runs pacman in its own system unit with the guard variable | read, nothing to port |
| new `omarchy-update-boot` | none on x86_64: `omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch` registers `update-verify` for Apple Silicon only (exit 0 elsewhere) | not mirrored; written in the helper's header |
| `omarchy-update-restart` reads each kernel's `modules.builtin` (4.0.6: `vmlinuz`) | the helper's restart rule used `vmlinuz` only | either file, owned by a package, in the running kernel's folder counts; Settings reads the folder's existence, true on both |
| `omarchy-update-aur-pkgs` exits 1 on a failure and unsets `GOROOT`/`GOBIN` | none: Grassfield's update runner never runs it (AUR apps are `deferred: aur`) | read, nothing to port |
| `omarchy-update` runs `omarchy-update-orphan-pkgs`, restarts services, clears the indicator with `omarchy-shell -q omarchy.system-update clear` | the shim answers that call (it strips `-q`); orphans were never part of the helper | read, nothing to port |
| `omarchy-refresh-pacman` renders the channel template with regional additions | `[grassfield]` is still appended last by the `pre-refresh-pacman` hook, which still runs after the copy and before `-Syyuu`; the x86 template is unchanged (same sha256) | comment only |
| migration 1788261467 writes `~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/hyprland-portals.conf` | it won over the session's routing: Settings, FileChooser, Access, AppChooser and Print went to gtk | the frontend reads ONE configuration per directory (per item of `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, in order), the user's directory first, so a system-wide `grassfield-portals.conf` would lose (tested). The Grassfield UWSM entry sets `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Grassfield:Hyprland`; the frontend's unit runs `grassfield-portal-config` first, which links the user's `grassfield-portals.conf` to the session's routing (a link of ours only, never over a file of the user's, Omarchy's file never touched). Nothing of the frontend's environment, or of the apps it launches, changes (an earlier design that gave it another `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` was refused: apps inherited it). The session's file also routes `Secret` to gnome-keyring. The Omarchy session is unchanged (no Grassfield item, the link is never read); a dangling link, once Grassfield is removed, is skipped. Side effect: `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` has a second item, read item by item by `UseIn=`, `OnlyShowIn`, Qt, GTK and Chromium |
| migration 1789764927 enables `owed.service` (video wallpaper, package `owe`) | a second wallpaper renderer in the Grassfield session | `owed.service.d/10-grassfield.conf`: `ConditionEnvironment=!GRASSFIELD_SESSION=1` (the shell draws the wallpaper, video included); the Omarchy session is unchanged |
| `input.lua` sets the XKB option `omarchy:shift_caps_compose` (Caps Lock stays Caps Lock, Shift + Caps Lock composes; defined in `/etc/xkb`) and requires `default.hypr.keyboard` | the compat check failed; Grassfield sets no `kb_options` of its own, so the Omarchy module's value flows through | the check accepts both options and follows what `input.lua` requires; the include's fallback (module unloadable) uses the new option when `/etc/xkb` defines it. This is the macOS behaviour: nothing to change in Settings |
| `davinci-resolve.lua` frees Preferences, Find Directory and "Dialog" windows from `stay_focused` | Grassfield's rule had the 4.0.6 title | the rule carries the 4.5.0 title on both (`omarchy_older_match`; `no_follow_mouse` is left out: click-to-focus) |
| `omarchy-theme-set` plays wallpaper intros through OWE, runs retints detached, mirrors to herdr machines | `grassfield-terminal-theme` keeps the run contained | read: the stand-in `hyprctl` also covers the new read of `animations:enabled`; the detached retints stay in the process group; the herdr mirror is Omarchy's opt-in toggle (header of the helper) |
| `omarchy-weather-location` and the weather panel detect the place through geo.omarchy.org | Grassfield's Weather widget keeps wttr.in (OC-14) | `weather.json` and `--set`/`--clear` are unchanged: nothing to port |
| `omarchy-capture-*`, `omarchy-menu-share`, `omarchy-brightness-display*` | notification texts through `omarchy-i18n`; DDC negative cache; a platform file for DDC | arguments and output contracts unchanged: nothing to port |
| the dictation backend system (`omarchy-dictation*`, `default/hypr/bindings/dictation.lua` replaces `voxtype.lua`); setups and hibernation scripts; the lock, idle and polkit plugins | reviewed by the shell and security work | PENDING in the lock (below) |

The drift lock follows the same rule as the support: **one lock per accepted version** (`docs/upstream/omarchy.lock` for 4.0.6,
`docs/upstream/omarchy-4.5.0.lock`), chosen by the newest migration of the tree under check, so it works for an installed
Omarchy and for a checkout; a tree no lock names fails (closed) with the list of known locks. A line `pending:<who>` marks a file of
that version not yet reviewed: the check fails on it by name until the reviewer replaces the field by the file's sha256. The reason
for a lock per version rather than several hashes per line: the review of a file is a statement about one version, and a hash
accepted for a version it was never reviewed against would pass silently (`scripts/dev/upstream-drift.sh` header).

NOT VERIFIED here (no Omarchy 4.5.0 session can run on this machine): the update through Settings on a real 4.5.0 machine
(`pkexec` helper, keyring refresh, the kernel rule after a real kernel update), the portal routing under the real systemd user
manager (the test starts the frontend with the session's environment and runs the real `grassfield-portal-config`; the unit's
`ExecStartPre` and Electron or Chromium with the two-item `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, screen sharing included, are not run here; the
container test of the helper needs a docker daemon), `owed` skipped at a real login, and `hyprctl`-free theme changes with 4.5.0's `omarchy-theme-set`.

### Corrections for the documents (integrator)
- ADR-0001, Decision: "If the include fails ... the shell shows one notification" is now true (a critical notification from
  `session.lua`, text fixed); the include is a capability check, no longer the version file; it loads `default.hypr.input` too.
  UWSM sets `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Grassfield:Hyprland` from the Grassfield session entry; the compositor config does not
  override the manager-owned variable. `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP=Grassfield` also identifies the session.
- ADR-0002, Keyboard: Ctrl+arrows and Ctrl+1..9 (Spaces) and Ctrl+Up (Overview) are kept as on macOS; Alt+Left/Right,
  Alt+Shift+Left/Right, Alt+Backspace, Alt+Delete are forwarded to the focused window as Ctrl word keys (not in terminals);
  Super+1..9 and Super+Up reach Ctrl+1..9 and Ctrl+Up in the application (Command+number); Super+[ and Super+] send Alt+Left/Right.
- ADR-0009 (per-ABI plugin variants) is still not implemented (one `.so`).
