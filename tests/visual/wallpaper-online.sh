# The online daily wallpaper end to end in the nested session (ADR-0016 step 2, Wikimedia Commons), against the loopback
# stand-in server (tests/unit/wallpaper-tool/fixtures/commons/server.py): the real network is never used, and the shell refuses
# any other base URL (dev session: loopback only).
#   1. The online source fetches (3 API requests and the bare thumbnail with the fixed User-Agent), prepares the picture and
#      shows it (nothing was cached: the artwork shows until the picture is ready, then the picture crossfades in).
#   2. Settings state: ready, the sanitized attribution, the cache folder 0700.
#   3. A new shell the same day makes no request (one fetch per UTC day) and still shows the cached picture.
#   4. A failed fetch (server error) keeps the previous picture on screen; the failure and the backoff are recorded.
#   5. The next day's picture replaces it through the two-slot crossfade: a capture inside the fade lies on the line between the
#      old and the new colour (fade_mid.py), which a hard cut would not.
#   6. Leaving the online source stops everything (no request).
# Usage (bare command): tests/visual/wallpaper-online.sh        Captures: $VS_SHOTS/wallpaper-online-*.en.png
