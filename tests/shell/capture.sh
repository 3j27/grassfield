# slurp, wl-copy, notify-send, hyprctl, xdg-user-dir, pkill, systemd-run, uwsm-app, gdbus): what it captures, in which colours,
# where and under which name it saves, what it copies, the notice and its "Open in Preview" (checks in capture.d/check.py).
# ADR-0045 OC-1: the capture toolbar's modes and options, screen recording with a fake gpu-screen-recorder, the private state
# the shell watches and `stop` (checks in capture.d/options.py). Nothing here captures a screen, records or reaches a bus.
