# Startup settle, wiring (review of fix/startup-settle): the Dock and the desktop show once, in place. The Dock cannot be
# instantiated offscreen (no PanelWindow backend), so the wiring is checked statically; the rules themselves are in
# tests/unit/tst_dockgeometry.qml and tst_desktopicons.qml, the store in tests/shell/startup_settle.sh, the picture in a nested
# capture burst. Fails when one of these is reverted:
#  * Dock: the windows are mapped only when settled; the first fill glides, fades and shifts nothing before it; the fallback timer
#    exists, uses the token and settles; settle() sets `settled` in a finally and starts every window's auto-hide machine from
#    AutoHide.initial(autohide); the inputs are the settings and the apps model only.
#  * Store: `loaded` flips after the document is taken (all three branches), and also for a missing file.
#  * Desktop: `lay` is empty until ready; `ready` waits for the listing, settings and widgets; entriesListed resets with the
#    folder; a stale (cwd) listing is refused row by row and nothing is pruned before a complete listing; Clean Up waits for
#    ready; an icon is invisible until whole, with a bounded wait.
# WIRING_ROOT (a copy of the tree) is for the mutant runs.
