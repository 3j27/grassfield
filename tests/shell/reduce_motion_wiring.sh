# Reduce Motion replaces motion with fades on the shell's free surfaces (ADR-0039 step 5, G10; macOS: slides become fades),
# checked statically: these surfaces need Quickshell and a compositor (the controls, Settings' spinner and Preview's animated
# images are tests/unit/tst_reducemotion.qml; the look is the nested pass). Fails when one of these is reverted:
#  * in the banners, the Notification Center, the Overview, Search, the stack popup, the OSD and the saver, every Behavior that
#    moves or resizes (any property but opacity, colour and the fades below) is off under Reduce Motion
#    (`enabled: ... !Appearance.reduceMotion`); the Overview's `progress` is exempt (under Reduce Motion it is the crossfade:
#    zoom 1, tiles at their opacity);
#  * a banner and the Notification Center fade in where they stand under Reduce Motion instead of sliding in;
#  * the stack fan's items stand at their places and only fade in;
#  * a banner dropped short of dismissing is back in place at once;
#  * the saver's slide crossfade stays a whole dissolve (not motion; macOS keeps its dissolves).
