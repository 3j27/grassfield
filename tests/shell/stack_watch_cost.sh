# What a watched stack folder costs (shell/dock/StackWatch.qml over grassfield-stack-helper, ADR-0025). Post-merge reviews: Qt's
# FolderListModel rescanned the whole folder on every change; one line per event kept the GUI thread busy for seconds in a burst; a
# watcher that read the events in bash cost 1,718 CPU ticks for one burst; round 7 of the counter-review found the bash/awk pipeline
# unable to bound its work (300 files every 5.5 s into 60,000 were a storm each time; a burst took 3 to 5 s at 5,000 names; the popup
# of 100,000 names was blank for 25 to 48 s). The real component and the real helper watch folders of 340 to 100,000 entries while
# files are created, renamed, deleted, streamed and dropped in batches by programs outside the shell.
#  - CPU: the shell, every helper it has finished (cutime, cstime) and the helper still running, in ticks (1/100 s), from 0.5 s
#    after the first window to the end of the case; counted above an idle run (the machine's rate of an idle shell with its helper);
#  - memory: the growth of the shell over the same stretch (a reading that cannot be taken is skipped, never counted as 0); for the
#    memory case the baseline is a warm shell (its helper has run on a small folder), then Kind order on 60,000 names, the pile and the
#    popup, and a gc;
#  - GUI: how late the 5 ms ticks of the GUI thread came (longest wait and total), over the same stretch;
#  - latencies from the guard's "TOP <epoch ms> <names>" lines: 150 files, a burst of 20,000, 300 files dropped every 5.5 s into
#    60,000, the refill after the 30 shown files are deleted, the open popup (300 entries) on a folder of 100,000, and the longest
#    time between two changes of the pile in an endless stream (the tail included);
#  - the pile must be right at the end: the first three of a full sort made here with find and sort, independently of the helper.
# The CPU and latency budgets are the targets of ADR-0025; the timing gates (latency, GUI waits) are load-sensitive: above the number
# of cores they are reported (SKIP), not enforced. Plain shell test.
