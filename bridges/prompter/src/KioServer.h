// grassfield-prompter's KIO password server (ADR-0035 D-12 b, owner decision Q11 = K1; step 9e; docs/specs/system-dialogs.md
// section 5, SC9-SC9c): org.kde.kpasswdserver6 at /modules/kpasswdserver, interface org.kde.KPasswdServer, on the bridge's
// own session bus connection (GDBus), its prompts asked through the shell's secret sheet as prompter/1 requests of kind
// "kio". The pure rules (the AuthInfo on the bus, the cache, the server's name, the keyring's protection) are KioAuth.h.
//
// - The name follows the shell (decision 9-36): requested with flags 0 (queued behind an owner, never replaceable) while a
//   shell that draws "kio" is connected, released when it goes, after every request still open has had its answer: KIO's
//   client waits for its result with no time limit (kpasswdserverloop.cpp:25-31) and hears only of the name being freed
//   (:16-19), never of it passing to another owner. The release comes kReleaseDelayMs after the answers (decision 9-37): a
//   client that reads its result and the name's departure in one turn of its event loop takes the departure, the later of
//   the two exit() calls, for the server's death (KIO::ERR_PASSWD_SERVER); meanwhile every new request gets "nothing". With
//   no shell, D-Bus activation starts kiod6 (KDE's dialog), as before step 9e; kiod6 neither queues for nor replaces a name
//   (kiod_main.cpp:107-115, Qt's defaults), so whichever holds it keeps it. kiod6 takes its names once, when it starts, and
//   a second kiod6 leaves at once (KDBusService Unique): a kiod6 that started while the bridge held the name never takes it
//   later, and D-Bus activation for it would time out (25 s). So the name is released only while kiod6 is not running;
//   else the bridge keeps it, answering "nothing" at once, until kiod6 leaves the bus; and a bridge that finds kiod6
//   running without the name takes it, kKiod6SettleMs after kiod6 appeared (the security review of step 9e, MINOR-1).
// - The object stays exported for the bridge's life; a call that reaches it while no shell draws "kio" is answered as if
//   nothing were known: no cache read, no sheet, nothing stored.
// - Results go to the caller only: each result signal is addressed to the unique name that asked
//   (g_dbus_connection_emit_signal with a destination), where kpasswdserver broadcasts them, credentials included
//   (kpasswdserver.cpp:330, 852, 883). The method reply (the requestId) always goes before its result.
// - kpasswdserver's rules (KioAuth.h): requestIds and the sequence number; one prompt at a time per window and per key, the
//   first query waiting holding the others (processRequest, kpasswdserver.cpp:485-566); a check that waits for a query of its
//   key (:293-304, 860-891); a query whose sequence number is older than the cache's entry is answered from it without a
//   sheet (:518-525); the user's Cancel kept as a cancelled entry (:962-967); a user name changed in the sheet moves the
//   entry to its new key (:941-948), and the key that was being prompted is released (kpasswdserver releases the new one
//   only, which leaves the old one blocked: decision 9-39).
// - Remembered passwords live in the Secret Service through libsecret (schema org.grassfield.NetworkPassword), never
//   KWallet, through libsecret's asynchronous calls only, on the bridge's GLib main context: storing into a locked keyring
//   makes gnome-keyring ask through gcr's prompter, which is this bridge (SC9c). addAuthInfo is answered at once and stores
//   in the background, only when keepPassword says the user chose "Remember this password" (decision 9-41); a check looks a
//   remembered password up (unlocking the keyring when an item is there: its prompt takes its turn in the shell's queue); a
//   query looks one up without unlocking, to tick "Remember this password" and fill the name.
// - A call that may hold one of gnome-keyring's unlock prompts (a store, a check's unlocking search) is never cancelled
//   while the Secret Service that holds it runs: a cancelled libsecret call dismisses its prompt, and gnome-keyring 51.1
//   aborts on the dismissal of an unlock prompt queued behind another one being shown (gkd-secret-unlock.c:244, the
//   g_assert of perform_next_unlock) and loses the next one when the shown one is dismissed (decision 9-50). A store holds
//   one of kStoresInFlight places for at most kStoreTimeoutMs, then goes on without it (its outcome logged when it comes);
//   when the Secret Service leaves the bus, its stores and searches end at once, and libsecret's shared service (whose
//   session belonged to the one that left) is dropped.
// - Who asks is resolved from the caller's bus credentials (Identity.h): a KIO worker (/usr/lib/kf6/kioworker, which runs
//   whatever worker plugin it is given) is the role "kio", whose text is another program's; else an app or "Unidentified
//   program". The server's name is a field of Grassfield's sentence, a host name only (KioAuth.h serverLabel).
// - Bounds: at most 8 requests (checks and queries) open per caller connection and 32 in all, beyond which a request is
//   answered "nothing" at once; a query shares the shell's bound of 8 with gcr's and NetworkManager's requests; at most 8
//   stores holding a place and 32 alive; the cache's entries (KioAuth.h). No time limit on a sheet (KIO's client has none
//   either).
// - Nothing secret is logged: request ids, kinds, servers, roles, refusals and why.
