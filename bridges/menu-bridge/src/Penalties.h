// Hostile or broken applications (a huge GetLayout reply costs the bridge several times its size in memory) and the
// state that survives a bridge restart (ADR-0008, docs/specs/menu-bridge.md MB14).
//
// Attribution is correct where possible and never blames an innocent application:
//  - EVERY crash counts toward the degradation budget, blamed or not: kMaxCrashes within any sliding window of
//    kCrashWindowSec make the bridge give up (it stops owning the registrar, the shell shows T0 menus).
//  - A crash is additionally blamed on an identity ONLY when the previous run died with exactly one outbound call in
//    flight, to one identity, and that call was fresh (kFreshCallMs). Anything else (several calls, none, a stale
//    call: the crash came from unsolicited traffic or from someone else's message) is "unattributed": it only
//    counts, it penalises nobody. Blame is a per-identity refusal on top of the count.
//  - An application is identified by what the bridge observed after the pid check: the systemd app scope of the pid
//    (instance suffix stripped, flatpak id included), the resolved /proc/<pid>/exe and, for interpreters, the script.
//    An unreadable exe (non-dumpable process, other user) or an interpreter command line the bridge cannot parse with
//    certainty puts the peer into ONE shared bucket "unknown", which is refused only for kUnknownDenySec and never
//    doubles, so innocents behind it recover. A pid is never a key.
//
// Offences: LayoutFailed (short back-off, 2^n s up to 64 s), Oversized and Crash (blamed as above): refused for
// 15 min, doubling per strike up to 6 h. A clean exit does not clear the doubling inside the decay window: an entry is
// dropped after 24 h without a new strike. Refused entries are not evicted by idle churn, but at most kMaxRefused are
// kept: past that the refusal closest to its expiry goes (capRefused). Idle entries (not refused) are bounded
// separately (least recently used first out).
//
// The state file `<socket>.state` mirrors whether the bridge is running ("run"), the calls in flight with their age
// ("inflight"), the crash times ("crash") and the refusals ("deny"). It lives in the socket's directory (mode 0700,
// owned by the user): only code running as the same user can write it, which can equally kill the bridge or pass the
// pid check for its own processes. It is written atomically (openat O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW temp file + renameat in the
// directory), read without following symlinks, size-bounded and fully validated.
