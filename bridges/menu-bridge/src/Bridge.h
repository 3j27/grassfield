// grassfield-menu-bridge core: the menu/1 socket for grassfield-shell, the gated registrar, and one MenuClient per
// window the shell opened (ADR-0008, docs/specs/menu-bridge.md).
//
// - One shell connection at a time; extra connections get an error and are closed.
// - com.canonical.AppMenu.Registrar is owned only while the connected shell's latest hello says "appmenu": true
//   (the plugin advertises appmenu and the menu bar renders bridge menus). It is released on hello "appmenu": false
//   and when the shell disconnects, so applications started meanwhile keep their in-window menus.
// - open: (service, path) come from the plugin's appmenu event, relayed by the shell with the registering client's
//   pid. The bridge resolves the bus name's owner and accepts the pair only if
//   org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID(owner) equals that pid (a client naming another app's bus name
//   is refused). It then talks to the unique name only.
// - open-registered (ADR-0008 amendment 2026-10-25): a window without a set_address registration whose Wayland client is
//   pid N is served the latest menu a sender of that process registered with com.canonical.AppMenu.Registrar
//   (Electron), through the same open path (pid re-checked, crash attribution, limits, back-off); never for a process
//   in another pid namespace. A window whose process has not registered yet waits; a newer registration of the
//   process replaces the open menu.
// - The bridge executes nothing: it only sends DBusMenu GetLayout / AboutToShow / Event calls.
// - LauncherEntry (ADR-0018): while it runs, applications' com.canonical.Unity.LauncherEntry.Update signals are
//   validated and forwarded to the shell as "launcher" lines (LauncherWatcher.h); the current state is replayed when
//   a shell connects.
// - ScreenSaver (GF-016, ScreenSaver.h): while it runs, org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver Inhibit/UnInhibit are served (the
//   name is owned when free, never taken from another owner) and the shell gets one "screensaver" boolean; replayed
//   when a shell connects.
