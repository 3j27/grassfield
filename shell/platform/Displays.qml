// Settings > Displays' link to the compositor (ADR-0031). The shell is the only Grassfield process that talks to Hyprland:
// - it publishes the monitors (Hyprland's own `monitors` answer, through Quickshell), the backlight and the trial's state in
//   a runtime file the Settings app reads (DisplaysFile.js has the format and the paths);
// - it runs a trial: when Settings writes the trial file, it asks Hyprland to read its configuration again (the request
//   `reload` through SessionConfig; config/hypr/grassfield/displays.lua applies the trial while it runs), publishes it
//   `applying`, then `applied` once Hyprland answers that very request (it has read the configuration: Settings takes Keep
//   only then), and takes it back after its deadline, on Revert, or when it finds a trial at start: the file is emptied, then
//   the configuration read again.
//   Keep empties the file without a reload and publishes `kept`; Settings then writes displays.conf (a Keep the shell did not
//   take, after its deadline, writes nothing). The countdown is the shell's, so a Settings
//   that crashed or was closed cannot leave a display in a mode nobody confirmed.
// In a dev session the files are under GRASSFIELD_STATE_HOME and the request socket is the nested Hyprland's.
