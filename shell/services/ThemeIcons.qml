// The one way an icon or picture the shell does not own reaches an Image: named by a notification, the polkit sheet, a
// desktop entry, an application, a tray item (StatusNotifierItem) or a file (Notifications, AuthAgent, the Dock, the
// Launchpad, the desktop, Search, the Switcher, the Overview, Stages, Force Quit, About, the menu bar's tray, media art,
// the lock screen's account picture). Integrator decisions after the reviews of 5ee6240 and 423766f: Qt never reads a
// user-writable icon file, and the shell only ever decodes images it produced itself.
//  - Qt's theme and fallback search paths hold only directories the user can neither write nor replace (Grassfield.I18n,
//    ui/i18n/iconsearchpaths.h, applied when that module is imported, before any binding; imported here too so no
//    lookup can come first). A plain theme name is looked up there (Quickshell.hasThemeIcon on the GUI thread reads only
//    root-owned theme files) and shown by its image://icon URL.
//  - Everything else is shown as a PNG the shell made: a name found only in the user's icon folders (a user-installed
//    application, a flatpak user export), an absolute Icon= path, a tray icon from the app's own IconThemePath, a
//    desktop picture's thumbnail, a stack preview, a media art file, the account picture. services/image-copy.py (python3
//    -I, a process of its own, never the GUI thread) finds the file (a plain lookup: theme directory x size folder x
//    apps|status|mimetypes|places|devices x png|svg, hicolor first, then pixmaps; no index.theme), opens it safely
//    (real path under an allowed root, O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK, fstat: a regular file within the size cap) and re-encodes
//    it with rsvg-convert, fed on stdin (no base URL: no reference to another file is ever followed), into
//    $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/grassfield-icons-<display>/<n>.png (0700, emptied at start, maxCopyBytes in all, the least
//    recently used copies deleted to make room). The Image loads only that PNG, asynchronously. Anything else (refused,
//    not made yet): the caller's generic icon.
// Media art named by an https URL (macOS shows the artwork apps provide; Spotify and browsers name https URLs) is fetched
// by the same helper (curl, https only, 5 MiB, 5 s, no cookies or credentials) and re-encoded like a file; one URL key
// per address, in the same budget and least-recently-used order. Only the newest asked URL is fetched (older queued ones
// are forgotten, asked again if still shown), and none while the session is locked: then only art already made shows.
// The copy directory belongs to the user, like every file of the session: a process of the same user can replace a copy,
// as it could the shell's own QML. The copies protect against what applications NAME (a path, a theme file, a FIFO, an
// SVG with references), not against code already running as the user.
// A copy is made once per run (a new notification naming the icon, or a new media art, makes a new one); until then, and
// when refused, the fallback shows. A helper that hangs is stopped (TERM, then KILL) and its keys refused.
