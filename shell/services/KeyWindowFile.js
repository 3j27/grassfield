// The file the shell writes so that the Grassfield apps know which window to draw as key (ADR-0039 step 17; the integrator's
// macOS decision on #88): a window keeps its key look while a shell menu or the Control Center holds the keyboard, and only
// another window taking the focus makes it inactive. Hyprland withdraws the window's activation as soon as a shell layer takes
// the keyboard, so the app cannot tell a menu from another window by itself. Pure functions, unit-tested
// (tests/unit/tst_keywindowfile.qml); shell/services/KeyWindow.qml writes the file, apps/keywindow.h reads it.
