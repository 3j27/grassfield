// The capture helper as the shell sees it (ADR-0045 OC-1; spec docs/specs/system-dialogs.md "Capture toolbar" and "Screen
// recording"): the helper's private state, watched (a countdown the capture toolbar's plate shows, a recording the menu bar's
// stop item shows), the helper run for the toolbar, and its stop: by the menu bar's item and when the session locks (a recording
// never goes on under the lock; a countdown captures nothing).
//
// The helper (packaging/bin/grassfield-capture) writes $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/grassfield/capture-state.json by rename; its folder is
// made first (0700, as the helper makes it): a FileView sees no file in a missing folder. A dev session runs no helper unless it
// names one (GRASSFIELD_CAPTURE_HELPER, ADR-0019: a fake in the nested checks) and reads its state from the dev state
// (GRASSFIELD_STATE_HOME), never the real session's.
